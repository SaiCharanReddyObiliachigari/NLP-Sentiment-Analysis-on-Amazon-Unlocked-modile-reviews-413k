I was told to send the phone back and they would send out another phone. I asked the representative to provide me with the ESN # so that I could call and make sure it was clear. I was told that they didn't have to phone available and was guaranteed it would be clear. I should've known something was wrong then. I received a second phone that turned out not have a clear ESN. The representative at Sprint informed me that the seller of these phones are aware the the ESN isn't clear. So once again I had to send another phone back. I asked for a refund for the phone and shipping since the sent me two phones that didn't have a clear ESN. I received my refund for the phone but have yet to see a refund for the shipping.

      "Bought this as an alternative to a smart phone and data plan. I use it with Go-Phone on a pay-as-you-go plan. The phone functions are great. The radio and music players are very good sound quality. The smart phone type features are easier and faster to use than any smart phone I have used. There are some software glitches that are documented on the Nokia support site which proved easily fixed. Even though many of the Nokia based features are no longer supported by Microsoft, you can still use the features needed by accessing the web directly via WIFI connection - or data if you want to pay for the privilege - and launching the site/application from there. Although the new Nokia browser is pretty Spartan in appearance, it is fast and runs with good stability. I am a very big guy with lands large even for my size and I find the full qwerty keyboard to be pretty easy to use. I like the programmable hot keys and on-screen shortcuts. Keeps you from launching items that require data connections by accident. The back lighting is thorough and even and the raised buttons are tactile with a positive click response. The phone does have a few quirks. There is no airplane mode as far as I can tell. The flight profile doesn't seem to be able to be set with the broadcasting and receiving functions turned off. The main navigation button/mouse is a little small and doesn't always respond as expected - that might be me though. All in all I would recommend this phone and vendor highly if you want the features of a smart phone but you don't need GPS or a big data bill every month for a bunch of things you don't need or want to keep you life running smoothly.\n",

      "First off, let me say I've been a Nokia user since I had my first cell phone at age 16, ten years ago. Of course there was that one year where I ventured off into Samsung land but that phone died and back to Nokia I went. But I've always enjoyed Nokia phones.Second, I've been looking for a QWERTY phone with internet/video/mp3 playing capabilities and the Asha 302 fits it. It is a strong build, as I have dropped it numerous times and the phone is still intact. I like the keyboard as I am not a fan of touchscreens at all (which is why I didn't get the Asha 303). As far as sound I think it depends on your headphones. I had earbuds that produced a loudness of 93 decibels which made the listening experience mediocre but then I bought buds with a 110 db loudness and the sound is much better. Nokia Xpress is a bit sucky but I downloaded an Opera browser for the phone and it works slightly better so internet experience is pretty easy. I won't get into video games and SNS because I don't even do that on my PC so I don't have a reason to use it on my phone.My only wish is that the 302 had a built in antenna so I could listen to re radio without RDS earbuds. Other than that, it's a really great phone and for those who want to move up into Blackberrys but don't want to pay so much the Nokia Asha 302 is a great phone to start with.EDIT (October 3, 2013): I found a Gino 25cm 4 Section Telescoping Stainless Steel AM FM Radio Antenna 3.5mm Plug to use for playing the radio through the speaker. So now I'm really enjoying the phone for when I'm sitting outside with friends or at my desk.\n",

      "This is a solidly-built unlocked phone that is an update to the popular Nokia C3. It runs the S40 software which has its goods and bads. It has good reception and nice audio. The 3g supports 850 and 1900 bands (AT&T and T-mobile when it's hspa is refarmed from 1700/2100 to the 1900 pcs band.) + the 2100 band.The keyboard is pretty good, not as firm as other Nokia qwerty phones (e.g. E5), but comparable to the C3 keyboard. The one that I have is obviously for the world market, since it has some added European chars and symbols on the keypad. Wi-fi works fine, and Opera Mini installed and runs without problems - good way to go for a bit of web-surfing. I did not tried any of the e-mail or social clients. Text messaging can be set to 'normal' in-box or conversation modes. OVI store app does not seem to work that well. There are a couple of features that I found appealing: ability to backup the phone memory to the sd card; ability to lock the keypad with a passcode either manually or automatically after a set time. The battery is fairly good sized (BL-5J). The 'function' keys and the d-pad keys can all be re-assigned to user defined short-cuts. My opinion: it is a worthy update (3g) to the C3, not quite in the same league as the more expensive E5 which has the multi-tasking S60 software. For the price of around $110, it is an unlocked feature (gsm/3g) phone well worth considering, as long as one knows that one is getting a non-smart phone and that apps for S40 is very limited.\n",

      "Preface: This is not what would be considered a smartphone in the United States (Nothing on the par of Android, iPhone, or Windows Phone), it is basically a feature phone. Also, although it says here that it has a US warranty all of the warranty material it came with referenced Latin American countries so I am not sure if it is really covered under a US Warranty. I returned it during Amazon's return window so it wasn't an issue. Now for the phone review.Pros: The phone has a great keyboard. If you are familiar with the E-series phones its that type of keyboard. The interface is some sort of modified Symbian and I liked it in a lot of ways. The style of the hardware is attractive and the Gray is a nice color. The camera was pretty decent considering it is only 2 megapixels. For e-mail it's adequate.Cons: I'll start with the small issues and work up to the big problem that ultimately made me decide to return the phone. The onboard social network apps are not fully functional. You can update your Facebook or Twitter status but the rest of it is so-so. The Ovi store in general is a poor app store, but this phone isn't able to use many of them. Even the old Facebook app that I used on my old E71 (It used to be called Snaptu but Facebook has since renamed it to Facebook for Everyone) is incompatible with this phone as are most of the better apps in the Ovi store. The browser was mediocre, barely passable. Also, NO GPS for this phone. Nokia/Ovi Maps is incompatible which is too bad because that has always been a Nokia strength. That immediately eliminates this phone as a smart phone. With all of that said, I bought this phone for my wife and she really only needed a phone for texts and calls so we could have overlooked these things. The problem we could not overlook was the very shabby, flimsy piece of metal that was supposed to hold in place the standard sim card. This little piece of metal was barely attached to the phone and would not lock into place to hold down the sim card. Because the sim card would intermittently get lose inside the phone and constantly lose the signal. So we would have to take the battery out and re-adjust the sim card. Then it would work for a little while only to ultimately have to repeat the process. It was WAY more frustration than it was worth. It's too bad because as a basic phone for calls, texts, e-mail, and occasionally updating your Facebook/Twitter status; this phone has a lot of potential. Becuase of the problem with the sim card holder, however, it was essentially unusable. I have used Nokia phones for years (I use a Lumia 710 personally) and I am really surprised Nokia would do such a sloppy job on something as important as the part that holds the sim card in place. What a waste.\n",

      "I bought this phone as a Christmas present for myself because I wanted something a bit more advanced than the Nokia C2 I purchased from Amazon in 2012, but didn't want to go all the way with a smartphone. In other words, a good feature phone with smartphone features without the touch screen. Red, however, is my favorite color, but I went for the white one because my C2 is silver and I couldn't find a silver Asha 302 on Amazon. I've had it for a week and it works great. Best is the Wi-Fi feature, which gives you access to the Web without purchasing a data plan (which I may have to do if I want to access personal email or go on Facebook). It has the great calendar, alarm clock, text messaging, camera, missed/received call and other features of the C2, which makes it a keeper. And it's a little bigger, with a wider screen, but not so big it can't fit into my pocket or purse. I can use the same Nokia charger I had for the C2. Now all I have to do is await the arrival of my purple phone skin, then I'll be all right. I've had Nokia phones since 1999 and they've never let me down - just get better!\n",

The texting interface is very nice and intuitive. The battery life is stellar. It connects to the internet just fine. I can check my email in case of emergency, look up directions, etc. Basically everything I was able to do with my smartphone, without the bells and whistles. Having a physical keyboard is quite nice too. The OS seems very stable and snappy. You have things like calendar, todo, memos, etc.Backup is a snap. Just insert an SD card and go to Settings to back it up. No more iTunes! If you want to add music or podcasts, just plug it into the computer, copy paste to the SD card and you're done.I would buy this phone again definitely if I broke or lost it.\n",

      "This phone, like all of Nokia's feature phones, are great for their value and durability. The last phone I had before buying this one was a Nokia C-3, which was also a great phone. It lasted for years, and probably would have kept going if I hadn't accidentally jumped into a pool with it in my pocket :P This phone is basically an update of the C-3. It is sleek and small, has a full QWERTY keyboard, and has Wi-Fi internet browsing. This is the best phone you can get if you're looking for functionality, but don't want to throw hundreds of dollars at a smartphone with a data plan.And the buyer should be aware; this is NOT a smartphone. If you're looking for anything like a smartphone, you will be disappointed. If you're looking for a toy you can take out of your pocket every couple of minutes to tinker around with, you will be disappointed. Yes, it does have an internet browser which works well, but the screen is quite small so it's not good for recreational browsing. I just use it to look things up, it works fine for that. It also has some social network apps, but I don't use them. I don't know how well they work, but if that's a priority for you this phone probably isn't the best choice. Same goes for the camera; I don't use it, can't speak to its quality, but if a camera is important to you this isn't the best choice.The only other potential negative I can see in this phone is that the keys really are pretty small. I haven't had an issue with them personally, but if someone has big hands I see how this could be annoying.I bought this phone for the advantages to NOT owning a smartphone: longer battery life, higher durability, lower cost, but still good at accomplishing what it needs to. If you're looking for the same thing, Nokia is definitely the best way to go.\n",

This Asha 302 phone is just that - all of the Symbian S40 simple goodness, with a much higher quality set of hardware. The screen is sharper, processor faster, phone takes nice clear pictures that are pretty much good enough, the ring and alert tones are more discreet and professional. The internet and mail stuff is actually useable on T-Mobile's 3.5G network and requires very little data to stay connected on a minumal plan. Strangely, I cannot it do wifi yet ... it receives the signal but just insists on using network data or nothing at all. Probably a setting in the menu I have not toggled to the right setting. Anyway - if you want a phone that texts very easily, has a 4-day battery, a very convenient and useable features, and yet not crack open the crack-pipe of the internet constanly, the Asha 302 does it with style and then some. I may get myself another one or two for the future, as I bet this is the end-run for this type of practical phone.\n",

      "Keeping in mind that this is a sub $100 phone that has generally been advertised as the \"cheapest quad-core phone,\" the Landvo L800 has turned out to be a good phone that has exceeded my expectations. From all my research, Landvo seems to be a new company and the L800 was their first model which they released in March of 2014. I took a risk (although less than $100 isn't a huge risk) in buying this in April with no reviews available. The main thing I was looking for was the most powerful, inexpensive phone at the $100 price point. Battery life was also a major factor. So I purchased this phone on the basis of being the only phone in the price range at the time with a quadcore processor and also because it sports a 2300mah battery which was about the largest battery at the price point of the available models.There were a lot of things I immediately liked about the phone. Despite the low resolution and lack of IPS, the screen is pretty crisp and the viewing angles are more than decent. The battery life has also been good--as I have been averaging two days of average use on a full charge. One day of heavy use would usually put me around the 30% range which still isn't bad. I also was almost shocked by the build quality. The phone is heavier than most name-brand competition in its size class but it has a weighty, solid feel too it. The sides are metal, as are the volume rocker and power button. There are no creaks and everything fits together tightly. Fit and finish is top notch. I believe the screen is plastic and not glass, however. Their are pros and cons to this as a plastic screen is susceptible to scratching. However, it does mean that I will never have to worry about a cracked screen if I drop the phone. The phone came with a screen protector prefitted on the phone and an additional one in the box. The included silicone case is relatively simple but was also a nice touch, especially owing to the fact that a no-name brand phone is unlikely to have third party support for cases and such.However, I would not have recommended this phone to anyone at the time. Why? Because performance was lackluster. The quadcore SoC is quite snappy however, the small 512mb of ram was suffering on Android 4.2.2. I was wary of purchasing a phone with less than 1gb of ram and I was regretting it at this point. It would freeze and stutter during even the simplest tasks such as hammering out a text. I put forth my best efforts to streamline my system as much as possible to keep it running smoothly but the fact was it just didn't have enough ram to power Android comfortably. I was ready to ditch the phone for something new.I have completely changed my tune, however, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this phone in a heartbeat. Why? Surprisingly, Landvo has supported with releasing an official 4.4 KitKat rom for the phone. For those who are tech savvy, this is a boon. KitKat was actually streamlined by Google so that devices with only 512mb of ram can run it comfortably (4.2 was a bit of a resource hog). At this point, I figured I had nothing to lose--I was planning on dumping the phone anyways. Needless to say, flashing to KitKat made a world of difference. The performance is literally night and day as upgrading to 4.4 literally got rid of *all* the lag I was experiencing with the phone. It is now quite fast--I would argue faster than my Sero 7 Pro tablet which is running the old but venerable Tegra 3 processor. Demanding, apps load quickly without stuttering. Animations are smooth and everything has become a joy to use with this phone.If you are looking for a ridiculously cheap, but fast 5.0\" Android phone with good battery life and good build quality, this is the one you are looking for hands down. It's not going to compete with TOTL phones out there but for a measly $95, you shouldn't be expecting that. What you get is a perfectly usable phone at an almost throw away price. I've noticed vendors selling the L800 with Android 4.4 already installed so it looks like the new stock of this phone has been upgraded.

      "I am a computer programmer, but I have to admit that I never made the transition to smartphone, mainly because I sit in from of a computer everyday anyway. If I need access to all those smartphone apps, I just use my laptop! Besides, the screens are tiny and I am farsighted, so that means if I use a smartphone, I am going to have to carry even more items: reading glasses.But I am an adventurous type, biking, motorcycling, hang gliding, scuba, etc. and could find myself in need of assistance during one of these risky adventures. And I do live alone and might need to get help in a car breakdown or a home injury situation. So I bought one of those pre-paid cells and thought, there you go that's problem is solved. No it wasn't. I kept pocket dialing. I couldn't see the screen either. But worse thing was the battery would go dead on me every few days. Since I never used the cell phone except for emergencies, I would always always forget to charge it. So a prepaid didn't work as my emergency phone.Jethro solved the problem. It is a big screen clamshell that is about as inexpensive as a pre-paid, but soooo much more useful. Because it is a clamshell, I get no more pocket dialing. Because it is a big screen, I don't have to carry reading glasses around. I am actually using it a little for taking TODO notes and using the calculator, as well as its great FM radio and flashlight. And its battery lasts more than a week in standby mode! Honestly, I haven't used it yet for a real emergency phone call yet (but I placed several test calls - works great) , but Jethro took my pre-paid T-Mobile SIM with no problems and I was up and running in a few minutes.So if you need a cellphone you can throw in your backpack or glove box in case of emergency, this is it. Plus it is inexpensive, so if you break or lose it, then \"No Biggie\".\n",

I set this up with Cricket service. The phone takes a MINI SIM CARD. Not a micro as someone else has stated. I had to buy another sim card because the micro I ordered was too small. Mini sims are the original, large cards. We live in the US. I don't know people are claiming this phone doesn't work in the US.

      "With a little bit of effort I was able to familiarize myself with this phone, and using it became intuitive. It came with a nice easy to read booklet, and before purchasing it I checked to see if it has a web, site which it does. I inserted the sim card and charged the battery which took a couple of hours. I did have several problems at first, but this was my first cell phone so I didn't have much experience. I mistakenly set the language to Portuguese so I couldn't figure out what to do. Luckily there were several online tutorials at the web site and I restored the phone to the factory setting. Once in English I was able to figure the phone out more easily. One thing I figured out was to use military time as in 2pm equal 1400 when setting the time as there was no am or pm setting. All in all I am happy with the phone. Being hearing impaired I am able to hear the basic ring which is loud. When I put it in my pocket I face the keypad to my leg as the speaker comes out the back and it's even louder. Same thing when I set it on the table I put it face down and the ring is loud and clear. I questioned about using a lanyard and e-mailed the Jethro company. They got right back to me and confirmed that a small hole on the upper left side could accommodate a lanyard by removing the back, feeding the lanyard through the hole and looping it around before replacing the back. The customer service was nice and answered my question in an easy to understand manner. The phone will lock in my pocket so it wont random dial. All I need to do is press the * asterisks until the screen says the phone is unlocked, then I can dial out. The phone always accepts a call without turning it on. This is exactly the simple phone I was looking for. I returned several that did not work. I went with this model so I can use it with Consumer Cellular which is less expensive. For $14.25 (with my AARP discount) I get 4 hours of talk per month.\n",

      "I bought it for my mom who is in her late 70s after her other highest rated \"senior\" phone stopped working. I hated that other phone as it was very confusing for me to operate the menu functions. So I took a chance on this one despite some of the complaints I read about in the reviews.Some of those problems have been addressed and corrected. It is no longer difficult to lock or unlock the keys. You press the lower left button down for a couple of seconds and the word locked comes up, I assume, since that's what it says in Spanish. I set my mom's phone to Spanish. There is a second way of doing it with a directional key, but we didn't need to try it since my mom got it right away. And she is definitely not good with technology.Another complaint was about the clock being set to military, or 24 hr time. Well, you can now choose to set it to 12 hr.The phone was easy to set, which was a relief for me, compared to her previous phone. Let's face it, it's the non seniors who will probably have to set it up. Sometimes in an effort to simplify phones, they take away buttons which makes them harder to navigate.The phone is very light weight. The ringer is loud enough. I like the cradle, which is easier for a senior. You can't beat the price. It worked well with the SIM card.On the negative side, I will agree with one complaint, it's not loud enough. I turned the volume all the way up and was afraid mom would not be able to hear the caller. She agreed to give it a chance, but we may have to exchange it since her hearing is not great. The back cover is thin plastic and I was afraid to break it when I removed it. I wish it had an alarm.When it comes to \"senior\" phones, it's slim pickings. This one is half the price of the old one and comes close to meeting all the requirements. Since most seniors are hard of hearing, they really need to make it louder.\n",

Fortunately it didn't cost much but what a waste of money.\n",

I was afraid I'd break the plastic pieces pulling off the cover to get to the battery and SIM card. We I nstalled 3 different SIM cards from Cricket Wireless (AT&T network) at their store and could not get it connected. Don't know for sure if it's something broken on the phone or just an incompatibility. Other reviewers saying they have connected on AT&T leads me to think something is wrong with the phone. This phone is going back. I'm going to try another brand.\n",

      "This phone is very difficult to unlock. To unlock the phone, you need to press the unlock key 3 times. The first press wakes up the phone, the second press results in a message which says to press the unlock key to unlock. The third press unlocks the phone. There isn't any easier method for unlocking the keyboard without disabling the lock altogether.If you are buying this phone for someone elderly with technology \"issues\" (as we did), they may have a lot of difficulty using this phone. If the three unlock presses aren't done quick enough, the unlock sequence has to be started again. If the unlock key is pressed 4 times, the phone will be locked again instead of being unlocked. All of this is very difficult to explain to someone with dexterity and technology issues.I have never heard of a phone that is this difficult to unlock. It's hard to believe that there isn't an easier method to unlock the phone. However, I have called customer support and they confirmed that the phone does take 3 unlock presses to unlock the phone. The only alternative is to disable the lock feature.On the plus side, the SOS key does work very well and doesn't require one to unlock the keys. The SOS key can be programmed to send text messages and call 911.Another thing to note is that the title for this phone indicates that there is an extra 20% off today. However, they raised the price by about 10% yesterday to $39.99. So, you aren't saving 20%. I hate when companies raise a price just so they can tell you that you are going to save \"more\". I paid the $29.99 \"black friday\" price which was lower than the normal price.\n",

      "Like a number of other reviewers I break these holsters every 3 months or so. Otterbox is good with their warranty but honestly it is a pain ( I get that - there are a lot of knock-offs). Their main competitor is even worse (no names mentioned). I like the Otterbox and have used them on three phones - all had the same issue with holster breakage. So I decided to give these generic holsters a try. I am one month into using them (and have two back-ups) - so far there have been no issues and they appear to look and work as well as the Otterbox brand at a fraction of the cost. If I break all three I will buy three more - easier and faster to get than replacements from Otterbox (not to even mention their \"competitor\". If you are willing to take a chance and \"go generic\" they are a good choice. July 15, 2016 3 1/2 months later - I am still using the first one. It looks like new and works perfectly. I do not treat these gently and am really happy with them thus far.\n",

Lots of time the scrolling will snag and the screen is unresponsive to the touch. I haven't been ablebto stop the hepatic feedback on the keys when texting\\ typing. It can feather and be used as a WiFi hotspot which is good. It's pretty slow loading pages and downloading, I haven't taken any pics yet.

If you're looking at the screen , you need to look straight on, at any angle, you can't see the screen detail. Gettingbthe back off is a struggle too but it's doable. It's plastic, not metal.

      "SLOW, SLOW, SLOW....I'm on my home network and my Nokia 635 has already loaded the weather channel local forecast. This phone is still loading....To restate other reviews: terrible viewing angle, despite adjustments to sensitivity of screen finally on the 55th tap, the screen responded to request....it seems to be hit or miss.....and this phone is just not up to USA phone standards....I'll probably be returning it altho it is a great looking phone !Other than making or receiving calls, this would just pretty much be a paper weight. I have to wonder about all the 5 star reviews....They sound mysteriously very similar in their language style and choice of words and phrases which makes me wonder if they are in fact valid. This is a perfect example of \"you get what you pay for\".....NOT MUCH !!!.UPDATE: August 20, 2015: I am so impressed with the Customer Service of this company ! I received the nicest e mail regarding my comments asking me if there was anything they could do to make my purchase right ! What company actually has personnel in customer service who READS the reviews of purchasers??? Apparently they do ! We have e mailed back and forth and it turns out that they had a newer model that is probably more of what I had in mind for a smart phone and I'm going to buy it. I also suggested that they update the product information on this product that is woefully lacking in tech information. I am told that is in the process of happening also.So I am updating my review to 4 stars because of the fabulous responsive customer service of this company and the fact that this phone may be right for someone who does not have the exact requirements in a phone that I do. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt based on the other reviews, which I was absolutely assured were valid, honest reviews from purchasers. Kudos to Shawyn & this company !!!\n",

All a plus however I am rating it a three as the phone feels like a toy phone very light weight , almost feel like it was break just at a 3inch drop, literally. Also the display is hard to read. I bought my oldest two children 2 Verizon pre paid phones for Amazon in October at only 15$ each. Yes only 15$ and they are awesome. This phone was going to be for me however due to the quality im going to give it to my youngest child.If you are looking for a small cheap phone this will work for you though !! :)I do think the phone is overpriced even at 40$\n",

      "Wow. So, I'm mourning the loss f my G2X, this is a temporary fix. It's the same size which is nice. It has almost no phone memory so an SD card isn't even an option ( you Need one). The sound if fairly good, functionality is glitchy. It's made in China and prefers to be set up with a google account. Lots of time the scrolling will snag and the screen is unresponsive to the touch. I haven't been ablebto stop the hepatic feedback on the keys when texting\\ typing. It can feather and be used as a WiFi hotspot which is good. It's pretty slow loading pages and downloading, I haven't taken any pics yet. It fleshy seem to want to play videos very well but that may be my phone company's hangup. If you're looking at the screen , you need to look straight on, at any angle, you can't see the screen detail. Gettingbthe back off is a struggle too but it's doable. It's plastic, not metal. The white one is white on the back, the face is black.\n",

      "OK, i'm unboxing this as we speak.1st thing I notice, is no fingernail indentations on the back cover. I cannot remove the back cover, so I can put my SimCard in....The instructions are Literally 1 page, with 1 picture. It shows the inside of the Phone, but it does NOT SHOW how to open the phone.There's no battery in the Box, so I sure hope it's INSIDE the phone already.OK, using a very thin piece of Steel, called a DRILL GAUGE, I was able to pry my way into the cover, without damaging it.The Battery is There, and I see the SimCard Slots. I'm removing the SimCard from my Old Phone (T-Mobile)...You MUST remove the battery, before putting the simcard in. The Sim card will not fit unlesss you do that.I've had the charger hooked up for a full minute, and the phone FINALLY flasshed something on the screen, before it blinked off again.The battery is Unbelievably drained. I doubt the manufacturer even Quality Control Tested it.I assume the Battery's charging, but there's no Indicator Light, letting me know.The battery's been charging for 5 minutes. The only way to get the screen to show me anything is to pop the battery out, wait a few seconds, and put it back in. It's at 1%.... 5 minutes of charging for 1%.... Do the math: It'll take 8 1/2 Hours to reach 100%.OK, Finally got the screen on, \"ipromobile.hk\" ... I have no idea what country \"HK\" is... next screen is in chinese, which was NOT SPECIFIED on the Product Description !It says \"Bahasa Indonesia\" with a Call Button. I select the Triangle (because I can atleast understand \"SHAPES\")....now something about wifi (i think), I click NEXT (i think), now a User Agreement in Chinese (i think), which i Null & Void if i cant read it, so I will ACCEPT if i can....After a bunch of button clicking and crap, I'm finally on the Phones Desktop-thing. Now I have to learn how to read whatever language this is, and change the damn thing to English...If only there was a Universal Symbol for \"LANGUAGE\". I mean, you know what the PHONE icon is, you know what the Voice Mail icon is, you know what the Bluetooth symbol... but what is it for LANGUAGE!?!?Seriously, the Language looks like a Cross between Japanese and Chinese... I cant even BEGIN to understand it....BOO YAH ! I got It ! It's in Chinese. I used Google Translate, to find the Characters for \"Language\":语言 --- Look for these 2 characters, in your phones settings, and Presto, you can select English. It's in a menu that looks like the Letter \"A\"I'm activating Data Connection, so my SimCard connects to The Network, adding my Google Account, verifying my account, YAY, I'm able to make phone calls.... That's all i need this little sucker to dao anyway....the internal phone storage says \"178mb\"...You Know, for being a cheap, $40 Piece of Crap, this thing seems to work better than my $600 LG G3. It may not have the CAPABILITIES of the more expensive phone, but this is still a pretty good little phone. Definately a good back-up phone, for when my High-dollar one breaks.\n",

I still haven't been able to use data on the phone and can only use for calls and texts. Also, I'm afraid to out this phone up to my ear. When I did, it burned really hot and radiated heat. It is cheaply made. The touch screen is fickle and unresponsive. It has zero in phone storage, so no apps. Bottom line is that I wished I would have spent a little more money and bought a different phone.\n",

      "SLOW, SLOW, SLOW....I'm on my home network and my Nokia 635 has already loaded the weather channel local forecast. This phone is still loading....To restate other reviews: terrible viewing angle, despite adjustments to sensitivity of screen finally on the 55th tap, the screen responded to request....it seems to be hit or miss.....and this phone is just not up to USA phone standards....I'll probably be returning it altho it is a great looking phone !Other than making or receiving calls, this would just pretty much be a paper weight. I have to wonder about all the 5 star reviews....They sound mysteriously very similar in their language style and choice of words and phrases which makes me wonder if they are in fact valid. This is a perfect example of \"you get what you pay for\".....NOT MUCH !!!.UPDATE: August 20, 2015: I am so impressed with the Customer Service of this company ! I received the nicest e mail regarding my comments asking me if there was anything they could do to make my purchase right ! What company actually has personnel in customer service who READS the reviews of purchasers??? Apparently they do ! We have e mailed back and forth and it turns out that they had a newer model that is probably more of what I had in mind for a smart phone and I'm going to buy it. I also suggested that they update the product information on this product that is woefully lacking in tech information. I am told that is in the process of happening also.So I am updating my review to 4 stars because of the fabulous responsive customer service of this company and the fact that this phone may be right for someone who does not have the exact requirements in a phone that I do. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt based on the other reviews, which I was absolutely assured were valid, honest reviews from purchasers. Kudos to Shawyn & this company !!!\n",

      "My niece is 15 and so hard on phones, my sister has spent a ton of money replacing phones because at 15 years old the right phone matters. I was given the opportunity to try out the Juning 5\" Android phone and passed it along to my niece because I knew it would be perfect for her.Starting with the obvious looks. Just by looks alone, it's amazing. It's Pink and that is something so different than the average phone you can get with a major carrier. It easily resembles a Samsung in size and button placement so she doesn't look \"uncool\" and the screen is BIG which is important as we all know.The phone easily connected to my homes wifi for set up and I was more than impressed with the speed of it. The quad core is very compatible to my iPhone 6s Plus but without the $750 price tag. It is up to date on android and had many features that my niece was looking for including a front facing camera for those snapchat selfies. There is plenty of space to download other apps from the Google play store once you get yourself set up too.It is a dual sim phone but my niece doesn't travel out of the country though if that's of importance to you having that extra SIM card port is amazing.**3G (WCDMA 850/2100) 2G Quad Band (GSM 850/900/1800/1900) **That is the specifics as far as what the phone is compatible with. We have T-Mobile and it worked with no issues or lag straight away when we popped her SIM card in. Keep in mind this is at 3G and 2G speeds, it is in no way compatible with 4G or 4G LTE services but as we all know, most companies throttle our data to 2G after just a few gb and I hardly notice at all. I honestly noticed no lag at all in this phone at 3G or 2G speeds.The phones comes with a charger, earbuds, screen protector and a silicone case. I tried a Samsung lightening charger I had around the house but it didn't fast charge the phone. The ear buds are pretty meh.. Nothing amazing and the silicone case is better than nothing. My niece likes it because it is clear and shows off that she has a very unique pink phone. It seems like it provides better protection than none but I'm not sure where to find others since this is kind of a newer brand of phone.Overall, I'd say this is a great phone. It performs great and. For the price, you really can't beat all the kick you get in this Android phone. I'm an iPhone lover but my son is wanting one of these Junings for himself now too and they come in a variety of colors so maybe we will give it another go.I did receive this item for free in exchange for my unbiased review however that did not influence my opinion in any way.\n",

      "This is a good wireless type of phone, the price is really cheap but the quality is good.This phone is already had the latest android system 5.1 lollipop.I don't need lots of specs on a phone, I'm not that tech on the phone.But in my end, I do like most phone work longer, easy to use, work as a friendly user.Anyway, one of the reasons why I have this phone, it's an unlocked phone, this phone can activate on a prepaid wireless network of your choice you can use either the regular sim card or the micro sim. The additional advantage is that you can use the phone in any country if you are into travel, this can be a helpful way to avoid roaming charges.Please watch my video.I received this product with a discount in exchanged for an honest and unbiased review.The reseller is not responsible for my opinion.

      " 5.0\" Phones Unlocked Android 5.1 MTK6580 Quad Core ROM 4GB 5.0MP Camera Dual Sim Quadband-JUNING GSM/3GCellphone Gold I am official a fan of Juning Phone. Not because i got in a special prize but this phone is really awesome! you wont regret having this phone. It functions like a a branded phone and really gives you a good use. the features of the phone are same like the branded phone we have. what i like most about this phone is there camera. the camera is really special and very clear once you capture a picture. another thing special about it, if you're a selfie addict like me you will definitely loved there camera. they have this feature in the camera that when you smile, the camera will automatically capture the image without touching the button! it is really cool! i was consume with it for an hour taking pictures of myself! when i first got the phone i only charged it for 2-3 hours and after that i used it, the battery last long. which is really good. Plus inside the box, it includes charger, headsets, a phone protector and screen protector. which is really cool! the screen is very wide. i enjoyed watching some movies and videos there. one thing i wanted to improve there is the phone storage. i hope it is more. but one thing another good about is you can extend the memory of your phone by putting a memory card on it. I really love this phone so much! i recommend this phone to all because it is really cool! it can be considered the best and be included in the branded phone that we have. you will not regret buying this phone because it is really awesome. i receive this product for free in exchange for my honest review.\n",

It is super easy to us,e and really sharp looking. I am not interested in paying hundreds, if not a thousand dollars for ANY PHONE! This has all of the functions anyone could ever need. I highly recommend this phone. The price is amazing, and its free shipping. My only con would be, it is a prime item, and it took 8 days to get to me...from the Midwest. I also don't really like the unverified purchase reviews given from obvious plants. I imagine they are \"given the phones in exchange for a review\", but are not actual purchases. I think this cheapens the integrity of the seller. This phone is high enough quality that it will speak for itself. The phone earned two, 5 star reviews from us, but the cheesiness of the planted reviews actually gives it a 2-3 star review. I would buy this phone again if something happened to the one I have.

      "My niece is 15 and so hard on phones, my sister has spent a ton of money replacing phones because at 15 years old the right phone matters. I was given the opportunity to try out the Juning 5\" Android phone and passed it along to my niece because I knew it would be perfect for her.Starting with the obvious looks. Just by looks alone, it's amazing. It's Pink and that is something so different than the average phone you can get with a major carrier. It easily resembles a Samsung in size and button placement so she doesn't look \"uncool\" and the screen is BIG which is important as we all know.The phone easily connected to my homes wifi for set up and I was more than impressed with the speed of it. The quad core is very compatible to my iPhone 6s Plus but without the $750 price tag. It is up to date on android and had many features that my niece was looking for including a front facing camera for those snapchat selfies. There is plenty of space to download other apps from the Google play store once you get yourself set up too.It is a dual sim phone but my niece doesn't travel out of the country though if that's of importance to you having that extra SIM card port is amazing.**3G (WCDMA 850/2100) 2G Quad Band (GSM 850/900/1800/1900) **That is the specifics as far as what the phone is compatible with. We have T-Mobile and it worked with no issues or lag straight away when we popped her SIM card in. Keep in mind this is at 3G and 2G speeds, it is in no way compatible with 4G or 4G LTE services but as we all know, most companies throttle our data to 2G after just a few gb and I hardly notice at all. I honestly noticed no lag at all in this phone at 3G or 2G speeds.The phones comes with a charger, earbuds, screen protector and a silicone case. I tried a Samsung lightening charger I had around the house but it didn't fast charge the phone. The ear buds are pretty meh.. Nothing amazing and the silicone case is better than nothing. My niece likes it because it is clear and shows off that she has a very unique pink phone. It seems like it provides better protection than none but I'm not sure where to find others since this is kind of a newer brand of phone.Overall, I'd say this is a great phone. It performs great and. For the price, you really can't beat all the kick you get in this Android phone. I'm an iPhone lover but my son is wanting one of these Junings for himself now too and they come in a variety of colors so maybe we will give it another go.I did receive this item for free in exchange for my unbiased review however that did not influence my opinion in any way.\n",

      "This is a good wireless type of phone, the price is really cheap but the quality is good.This phone is already had the latest android system 5.1 lollipop.I don't need lots of specs on a phone, I'm not that tech on the phone.But in my end, I do like most phone work longer, easy to use, work as a friendly user.Anyway, one of the reasons why I have this phone, it's an unlocked phone, this phone can activate on a prepaid wireless network of your choice you can use either the regular sim card or the micro sim. The additional advantage is that you can use the phone in any country if you are into travel, this can be a helpful way to avoid roaming charges.Please watch my video.I received this product with a discount in exchanged for an honest and unbiased review.The reseller is not responsible for my opinion.

      " 5.0\" Phones Unlocked Android 5.1 MTK6580 Quad Core ROM 4GB 5.0MP Camera Dual Sim Quadband-JUNING GSM/3GCellphone Gold I am official a fan of Juning Phone. Not because i got in a special prize but this phone is really awesome! you wont regret having this phone. It functions like a a branded phone and really gives you a good use. the features of the phone are same like the branded phone we have. what i like most about this phone is there camera. the camera is really special and very clear once you capture a picture. another thing special about it, if you're a selfie addict like me you will definitely loved there camera. they have this feature in the camera that when you smile, the camera will automatically capture the image without touching the button! it is really cool! i was consume with it for an hour taking pictures of myself! when i first got the phone i only charged it for 2-3 hours and after that i used it, the battery last long. which is really good. Plus inside the box, it includes charger, headsets, a phone protector and screen protector. which is really cool! the screen is very wide. i enjoyed watching some movies and videos there. one thing i wanted to improve there is the phone storage. i hope it is more. but one thing another good about is you can extend the memory of your phone by putting a memory card on it. I really love this phone so much! i recommend this phone to all because it is really cool! it can be considered the best and be included in the branded phone that we have. you will not regret buying this phone because it is really awesome. i receive this product for free in exchange for my honest review.\n",

      " I am so glad technology has evolved so much. From walkie talkie to a smartphone. It's such a huge leap, right? And I'm thankful to all the genius behind the creation of this technology because it has definitely made my life easier. I can still live without a smartphone but life won't ever be the same again.And talking about smartphones, I got the Juning T5 smartphone. It is an unlocked android 5.1 lollipop phone with a 5.5 inch screen size. It has all the features of a regular smartphone camera/video, sound recorder, calendar, clock, music, email, fm radio, flashlight, etc. And for full specifications, here's the linkhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B01GYUDMFY/ref=ya_aw_od_pi?ie=UTF8&psc=1This is a very cool phone because of the screen resolution which is very clear. The touch screen response time is very fast too. The camera, video and sound work very well. And since this is already unlocked, you can just choose whatever carrier you want and buy a sim from them and use it on this phone and it will work without issues. Just make sure to buy the GSM/WCDMA SIM card.One of my favorite features of this phone is the smartwake feature. You just have to tap the screen and it will turn the screen on. I also like the fact that the screen size is big enough to see pictures and videos clearly or read texts without difficulty.There are many emerging new smartphones in the market nowadays but Juning smartphones are highly competitive in terms of size, features and especially price.So if you are looking for a trustworthy brand, look at Juning smartphones' direction sold by Qianhai Changying. They have plenty of models to choose from. And this particular model, the Juning T5 has a very good value for the money. It's yours for only $77.99.I got this product for free in exchanged for my honest review.\n",

It is up to you what color do you like to get. Plus this phone has a built in wifi, blue tooth, tethering and portable hot spots so no need for us to worry on how to connect to the internet if we are on the go..I was amazed with this phone it does exceeds my expectation especially when i tried using the camera it really amazes me how clear and how nice the pictures are plus the volume of this phone is very good I cannot ask for more I am very happy and so glad that i ordered and got this phone for myself...For under a hundred dollar price this phone is a very good bargain for you guys..So far so good, for now i do not have any complains about this product I will totally recommend this product to my friends and family because this phone is real nice...I received this product for free in exchange of my honest and unbiased review.

Not a big deal to me, as I generally interchange several covers regularly anyway.What I also like the most of this phone is, it's is dual sim, it means I can use two SIM cards at the same time. Also, the screen is very well responsive and the picture/video quality is excellent! It has a big viewing screen...resolution is great, it's thin, relatively lightweight, very well made, quality construction. Camera is excellent, it's very easy to use.

      "Eye candy, this phone is hand candy. Must see in person to appreciate the beauty of this phone. I love all the phone functioning, the volume button. I love the phone case. I love the design of the phone it's sleek and slim. It fits easily in my purse and comes with a screen protector. It comes with a jelly phone case. It pairs great with my Bluetooth speaker. I love that it connects well with my WiFi. It gives a clean crisp screen every-time. The phone looks like it costs about five hundred dollars but it's affordable. I love the color pink. Its a new brand to me but a great brand if your looking for something high end but at a low price, JUNING is your brand. Its a quality product. I love that the phone gives me freedom to access my facebook page, twitter, instagram, and any other social network I might be signed up to. Most of all gives me the freedom to talk has clear sound, no dropped calls.

      "I am very satisfied with this phone because of the amazing features it offers. With the price of $77.99, you can never go wrong with this phone. It has cool features that's similar to those popular and expensive brand of phones. It's great not having to spend a lot to be satisfied by such product and this Juning 5.5 Android unlocked phone has exceeded my expectation. Pretty impressive!It's almost the same size as the iPhone 6 Plus and it's very slim, so it is not bulky if you want to put this in your pocket. Indeed a pocket-friendly phone. The phone itself is user friendly, which means it is very easy to use and does not contain features that is hard and complicated to use or operate. Simply amazing! It is an unlocked dual sim smart phone, so it is really perfect for us to use any GSM simcard that we want and we can use this phone as back up phone as well whenever we want to travel to another country.One of my favorite features of this phone is the voice search which is very similar to Siri app in iPhones. Very convenient feature! You don't have to type what you want to search just in case you feel lazy and tired. You just press the voice search, say what you want to search and voila! it will automatically give you the results of what you've been searching for.This phone has satisfied me in many ways. For a budget friendly phone like this, there's no regret. I am indeed very happy. Highly recommended!I received this phone for free in exchange for my honest review and opinion. This review is entirely unbiased and is not dependent that I got this item for free. I hope you find my review helpful.\n",

      " I am so impressed with this T5 model unlocked phone from JUNING. Impressive, why? Getting an android phone for $77.99 is awesome, with all the great features that other expensive phone have and it works great with our wifi connections and also works great while using my GSM sim card. Works smoothly and fast because of the processor unit that is quad core which is the fastest CPU that can be found on expensive smartphones and has an android 5.1 that provides a performance and stability updates, multiple SIM card support, HD voice calling and \"Device Protection,\" which secures lost or stolen devices against factory resets. It has a dual unlocked sim, which is great for a person like me, I have a small business and my business phone number is always separated to my personal number, mostly I will not talk to customers on weekends so that I can spare time with my family. Another thing is, because it’s unlocked, it can be use or compatible to all gsm networks and works great while traveling to different places.Talking about the camera, I am surprisingly amazed even though it’s only has 2.0 MP both front and back but it’s really clear, it seems that it has a 5.0 MP same as my camera before with 5.0 MP. Watching a video and listening to music to it, are totally responsive without any hang ups experience, the audio is totally clear and loud. Last but not the least that I love the most, is the wide touch screen that I didn’t have before, the screen is wide and crisp with a decent resolution and most of all it is slim, thin and lightweight and a slick product, so fast to response with only a soft touch. It is really impressive and very affordable to everyone. I’ve been using this as my regular phone for a couple of days now and I really love the way it works and the appearance on this phone is very classy and so handy. As you can see on the images below the back cover has rough surface with a good grip to prevent you from dropping it. The package includes: T5 model phone, Battery, USB Cable, Power adapter and earphone. This phone has 4 color options to choose from, Black, gold, pink and white. Indeed, Impressive worth to keep and handle with care. Highly recommended to everyone who's searching a affordable phone that works great. Thank you JUNING for this awesome product. I got this for free/discounted price through a promotional period and this is one of those deals where I am so blessed to get and test the efficiency and assess it for their future buyers. This will make it easier for others to find this review so they may be helped as well. I don’t get anything from it, but I get a good feeling that I helped someone. I am in no way required by the seller to leave positive remarks about their product. Thank you for taking the time to read my review.\n",

      " I am so glad technology has evolved so much. From walkie talkie to a smartphone. It's such a huge leap, right? And I'm thankful to all the genius behind the creation of this technology because it has definitely made my life easier. I can still live without a smartphone but life won't ever be the same again.And talking about smartphones, I got the Juning T5 smartphone. It is an unlocked android 5.1 lollipop phone with a 5.5 inch screen size. It has all the features of a regular smartphone camera/video, sound recorder, calendar, clock, music, email, fm radio, flashlight, etc. And for full specifications, here's the linkhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B01GYUDMFY/ref=ya_aw_od_pi?ie=UTF8&psc=1This is a very cool phone because of the screen resolution which is very clear. The touch screen response time is very fast too. The camera, video and sound work very well. And since this is already unlocked, you can just choose whatever carrier you want and buy a sim from them and use it on this phone and it will work without issues. Just make sure to buy the GSM/WCDMA SIM card.One of my favorite features of this phone is the smartwake feature. You just have to tap the screen and it will turn the screen on. I also like the fact that the screen size is big enough to see pictures and videos clearly or read texts without difficulty.There are many emerging new smartphones in the market nowadays but Juning smartphones are highly competitive in terms of size, features and especially price.So if you are looking for a trustworthy brand, look at Juning smartphones' direction sold by Qianhai Changying. They have plenty of models to choose from. And this particular model, the Juning T5 has a very good value for the money. It's yours for only $77.99.I got this product for free in exchanged for my honest review.\n",

      " I am so happy that I got this phone because it carries a lot of cool phone features that i really like. It has 5.5 inches display size which i think is a perfect phone size...It is a half inch bigger than my other phone but yet the weight is just the same and i find it quit good because i still can carry it where ever i go and with the bigger screen size i can totally see every thing clear...I like that it is unlocked and has dual sim card and a memory card slots you can use a regular sim size and a micro sim card i find it very nice because if you go to other country you can just bring this phone and use it right away you just need to get a GSM sim card if your here in the US GSM sim card includes t-mobile, AT&T, cricket, straight talk and sprint how cool is that...This phone's support network's 2G and 3G it does not support 4G which is alright with me...This phone has four available color to choose from there is black, gold, pink and white for you to have. It is up to you what color do you like to get. Plus this phone has a built in wifi, blue tooth, tethering and portable hot spots so no need for us to worry on how to connect to the internet if we are on the go..I was amazed with this phone it does exceeds my expectation especially when i tried using the camera it really amazes me how clear and how nice the pictures are plus the volume of this phone is very good I cannot ask for more I am very happy and so glad that i ordered and got this phone for myself...For under a hundred dollar price this phone is a very good bargain for you guys..So far so good, for now i do not have any complains about this product I will totally recommend this product to my friends and family because this phone is real nice...I received this product for free in exchange of my honest and unbiased review. I am not affiliated with this company and having this phone for free did not change or affect my thoughts about this product.\n",

      " This phone is pretty neat. For the price, it’s impressive – especially because it is unlocked and can be used with any carrier that has a large SIM card. This phone does not support 4G LTE internet, but does support 3G. This only means that the internet is a tad slower than some other phones that support 4G. It operates much like other android/google phones that I have come into contact with. It features a quad core processor, 1GB RAM, a 2.0 megapixel front camera and 5.0 megapixel back camera. It also includes dual flash, one on the front and one on the back which is pretty impressive. Wifi is enabled and it can be run off the wifi at home if there is no SIM card currently available. The back of the phone is very flexible but thin so be careful taking the back off – there is a small piece of tape over the battery connector to make sure the battery is charged before use. There are currently no cases available for the phone so be careful when handling it, overall, I’m very happy with the phone. It does everything that I need it to do and is an affordable alternative to shopping at the store (where its more expensive). It supports many apps, its a mobile hotspot, Youtube, Facebook, emails, messaging, Bluetooth, music, and more!Pros:• Affordability• Functionality (Wifi + Data)• Can be used on most carriers• Huge screen• Front and back flash• Quad core processor• Comes with a screen protector and clear case• Large font optionsCons:• Lack of cases and accessories for the phone• Camera quality could be improved• Support for 4G would be nice• Very slight sound distortion when using speakers all the way up for musicI would definitely repurchase this, it is perfect for my mother who uses her phone at work and to message on Facebook.I received this item for free in exchange for an honest, unbiased, and authentic review. I have thoroughly tested any product I review - I take pride in informing potential customers about the perks and flaws of products. I have no affiliation with the seller and am not obligated to leave a positive review.\n",

I also like the size of the phone and it has a good solid feel and weight. This cell phone came with a screen protector already installed and additional screen protectors in the package.

      " Phone looks very nice, with a note equivilent hd screen. The OS is android 5.1, I am unsure if android 6.x is supported. Device has a light duty, slightly flimsy case, you will need to be careful taking it on and off as you could crack it while doing so. It also comes with a screen protector pre-applied so all you have to do is take the plastic bit off of the front and the screen protector is good to go. All of the software on the phone works fine, it has wifi, bluetooth, and sim signal. It has spots for 2 sim cards and 1 sd card, which will be great as an international phone if you plan on going out of the country. cameras both work fine, not super high MP but nothing to be worried about if a phone is your main camera. The phone is fast and I haven't had any trouble running basic apps over wifi like web browsers of facebook app. Basic games seem to work fine as well and run without a hitch. No downside that I can see outside of not being 4g/lte capable. Great phone for the price. Would love to get another one from same seller for my mother.I have received the item at a discounted price in exchange of my honest and unbiased review.\n",

      " This phone is a very pretty looking phone. It offers a slim profile however still great battery length. The quality is great. I was really satisfied with both the video and sound the phone offers. I have to say the color of the phone is one of my favorite features. It's not a tacky gold color. It don't appear cheap. It's actually more of a flat yet metallic look. The phone is very comfortable to hold and definitely isn't heavy. The battery, sim card slot, and SD slot are very easy to access and use. For me, this is very beneficial as I have to swap batteries often since I have to be on mobile web many hours a day. I often have to store photos and files on the SD cards for work. I also flip my sim cards between phones for work as well. This phone made things more convenient for me. The next favorite feature is the hot spot and tethering. I tether often with work and home life. I live in a town where the internet is very slow, and when I turn my tethering on, I can accomplish all my tasks faster than if I had just used my home wifi. The phone comes preloaded with both apps and quick load tabs. If your a busy person on the run like I am, these features are lifesavers. I often have to swap back and forth between four apps, and use many internet pages all day long. The fast tabs stop you from typing in URLs incorrectly. This phone helps me in both my personal and work life. The phone holds signal better than the prepaid phone I use. The battery life seems to last longer as well. I really enjoy this phone. I've enclosed a video to see the features of the phone. I would recommend this phone. I received this phone for free or at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest opinion.\n",

      "Let me begin by saying that this is a wonderful cellphone. I was just impressed with all the quality, features and capabilities that it has. It's very comparable to leading Smartphones and IOS in the market today but at a reasonable price. When i opened the box, it contained all the accessories i need for the cellphone, you name it USB charger, manual, battery pack, headphones and also has extra case and screen protector that normally won't be included when you buy other cellphones. I love that it has dual camera, 2MP on the front and 5MP on back. This smartphone has all the features you would want like camera, messaging, bluetooth capability, WIFI, clock, calculator, wallpapers, calendar, email, GPS, FM, 3G and most of all can download tons of apps in the Play Store. I got the white color and just loves it, very light and thin, it downloads apps quickly, has very responsive touchscreen as well. I received this Smartphone at discount for an honest and unbiased review. All my reviews are completely my own and are based on my overall personal experience using the product. I leave reviews to help other customers make good buying decisions. I definitely would recommend this cellphone. What an excellent buy for what you get all in the package, plus it's unlocked so you can use it with any GSM providers. Not to mention it also has dual sim card slot and with great coverage. I'm very pleased with my new cellphone. It's definitely an Awesome buy!!!\n",

I've been using this mainly for watching Youtube. My son loves using this as the screen is way bigger as compared to my iPhone 5C.This also came with a screen protector and a clear case that's a little gray in color. It is a dual sim card phone and you can also put an SD card inside the phone if you want to expand the memory.The only downside of this phone is the lack of internal space memory. I can't freely download anything I want into this phone because there's not enough space and right now I don't have a spare SD card to use for this phone. I really wish that for a nice phone like this, they should just make this an 8GB memory space rather than 4GB.Over all, this phone works as expected.

My old one was several years old and not working very well.I was very happy when I opened this phone and saw how big and clear the display is. This unlocked cell phone by Juning comes with the cell phone, battery, phone case, charger, USB cable and an earphone. It also has a thin screen protector on it.The phone itself is slim, lightweight and built well. It is 5.5 \" and has both front and back cameras. It is 3G which is fine as we mostly use wifi anyway. The camera is one of my favorite things about this phone. It takes awesome, clear, bright pictures!This cell phone stays charged for a long time even with lots of use. I love that it doesn't have a ton of pre-installed, useless apps on it that you can't uninstall. It also charges from the top instead of the bottom like most phones do which is great of you like to use your phone while it charges.This is a great phone for the price and I would definitely recommend it to my family and friends.I received this unlocked cell phone by Juning for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.

And finally, when I got this Juning 5.5\" unlocked cell phones I never hesitate of purchasing this and would love to try this since this is my first time to have a unlocked phone. And when it arrived I was really impressed of how this phone looks so nice. The screen is so big and it is very slim and lightweight. It already has a screen protector and a phone casing. So I am not worried about how to find a phone casing because it is already included plus with a portable headset and a charger. So this is already has complete set. So I used my Verizon phone carrier and see if it does really works and I was totally impressed that it works. I got 3g of my phone which I can use it for wifi only. So far I like it. It works okay. As you can see in my video that I was provided you can see how does it works.And to my over all rating for this one so far this is nice for a reasonable price.I am so glad that I was given an opportunity to review this product for free in exchanged of my honest opinions.\n",

Some of the apps like Facebook,playstore,weChat and WhatsApp are already downloaded on the phone.Its really cool and advance smartphone you could ever find it work same thing as the galaxy phone but 1/4 of a price.DISCLEAMER:I receive this product at discounted price or for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. My review is base on my honest opinion and has nothing to do with the price I paid for the product.\n",

      "First thing you need to do on this phone is that set up a Google account to run your play store. It already have pre-installed Facebook, whatsapp, and gmail but you can install also other app that you love. The storage can hold up to 8GB enough space for you to save pictures, videos and games etc.Unfortunately this cellphone is only 3G but you can still use internet, on your phone by your SIM card or wifi works as good as 4G phones. I use sprint SIM card because it is the only phone company works at my area since l live out of town. But you can also use this phone with any other prepaid sim card.All in all this is a decent phone and it works good, affordable and user friendly. Though you can't compare this phone to a high end phone because you can still spot a difference. For the price this is a decent phone. I will recommend this phone.Disclaimer:This phone is provided for free to test and to review. My review is mine alone and it all honest and unbiased. It doesn't affect my review by receiving the product for free. Me myself I also rely on reviews before purchasing products, and I believe honest review is vital to other and to myself as well. I hope this helps. Thank you.\n",

      " The JUNING phone I got was a 5.5\" Dual Sim Phone Unlocked 3G/GSM Android 5.1 Quad Core. Color : GOLDThe functionality of the phone is very similar to any Android phones but this one is very affordable and unlocked.The phone comes with:*Charger (USB-port)*Earphones*User's Manual*Clear phone case*A piece of paper with the note in order to use the battery.(remove the yellow film)*Attached to the screen already,the screen protection/scratch protection (a thin sheet)Like any other phones you got to test the functionality of it and I find it very easy to navigate. It has the default apps that we commonly use, like Facebook, Wechat, Whatsapp, ect. I added Facebook Messenger, Youtube, Google chrome web browser and even added NETFLIX.Camera, which we mostly use to capture the moments and share it to our family and friends. I have no complain, it captures very clearly.Battery wise, I fully charged it the first time and I watched one full movie for like 2 hours and it has still a little half of the battery. I was able to explore some of the features, check emails and do some social networking.But you got to read the label or the note that comes with it because there is a little film that you need to remove in order for you to use the battery.Size and weight: I think it is the perfect size of the screen for me and not heavy at all to carry around. The GOLD color is a plus, it looks so sophisticated and sleek.If you wanna do some screenshots, just press the button volume down and power button together. Because it is 3G you do not expect it to be as fast and quick as 4G.I connected it to my Wi-Fi and and connects pretty well.Over all impression: For this price of an Unlocked android phone is pretty good. If you go overseas and you need a phone that is unlocked and you can just plug in a prepaid sim card, this is a perfect solution and highly recommend this. You don't have to carry your phone that will charge you enormously when you use it overseas.I tried my T-Mobile sim and it works well.Got this phone in a discounted price for an honest review based on my experience while using it. And to help others who are looking for affordable and unlocked phones that works like any android phones that are expensive.\n",

      "This phone is very good for daily use like calling, texting, social media or net surfing. It's fast and the big 5.5\" inch screen is making things on the screen bigger and easy to read. I've been using this mainly for watching Youtube. My son loves using this as the screen is way bigger as compared to my iPhone 5C.This also came with a screen protector and a clear case that's a little gray in color. It is a dual sim card phone and you can also put an SD card inside the phone if you want to expand the memory.The only downside of this phone is the lack of internal space memory. I can't freely download anything I want into this phone because there's not enough space and right now I don't have a spare SD card to use for this phone. I really wish that for a nice phone like this, they should just make this an 8GB memory space rather than 4GB.Over all, this phone works as expected. For the price it's fair and a good size Android phone to have especially if you like YouTube or watch videos online.\n",

      " This phone is a very pretty looking phone. It offers a slim profile however still great battery length. The quality is great. I was really satisfied with both the video and sound the phone offers. I have to say the color of the phone is one of my favorite features. It's not a tacky gold color. It don't appear cheap. It's actually more of a flat yet metallic look. The phone is very comfortable to hold and definitely isn't heavy. The battery, sim card slot, and SD slot are very easy to access and use. For me, this is very beneficial as I have to swap batteries often since I have to be on mobile web many hours a day. I often have to store photos and files on the SD cards for work. I also flip my sim cards between phones for work as well. This phone made things more convenient for me. The next favorite feature is the hot spot and tethering. I tether often with work and home life. I live in a town where the internet is very slow, and when I turn my tethering on, I can accomplish all my tasks faster than if I had just used my home wifi. The phone comes preloaded with both apps and quick load tabs. If your a busy person on the run like I am, these features are lifesavers. I often have to swap back and forth between four apps, and use many internet pages all day long. The fast tabs stop you from typing in URLs incorrectly. This phone helps me in both my personal and work life. The phone holds signal better than the prepaid phone I use. The battery life seems to last longer as well. I really enjoy this phone. I've enclosed a video to see the features of the phone. I would recommend this phone. I received this phone for free or at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest opinion.\n",

      "Let me begin by saying that this is a wonderful cellphone. I was just impressed with all the quality, features and capabilities that it has. It's very comparable to leading Smartphones and IOS in the market today but at a reasonable price. When i opened the box, it contained all the accessories i need for the cellphone, you name it USB charger, manual, battery pack, headphones and also has extra case and screen protector that normally won't be included when you buy other cellphones. I love that it has dual camera, 2MP on the front and 5MP on back. This smartphone has all the features you would want like camera, messaging, bluetooth capability, WIFI, clock, calculator, wallpapers, calendar, email, GPS, FM, 3G and most of all can download tons of apps in the Play Store. I got the white color and just loves it, very light and thin, it downloads apps quickly, has very responsive touchscreen as well. I received this Smartphone at discount for an honest and unbiased review. All my reviews are completely my own and are based on my overall personal experience using the product. I leave reviews to help other customers make good buying decisions. I definitely would recommend this cellphone. What an excellent buy for what you get all in the package, plus it's unlocked so you can use it with any GSM providers. Not to mention it also has dual sim card slot and with great coverage. I'm very pleased with my new cellphone. It's definitely an Awesome buy!!!\n"

      " This phone is pretty neat. For the price, it’s impressive – especially because it is unlocked and can be used with any carrier that has a large SIM card. This phone does not support 4G LTE internet, but does support 3G. This only means that the internet is a tad slower than some other phones that support 4G. It operates much like other android/google phones that I have come into contact with. It features a quad core processor, 1GB RAM, a 2.0 megapixel front camera and 5.0 megapixel back camera. It also includes dual flash, one on the front and one on the back which is pretty impressive. Wifi is enabled and it can be run off the wifi at home if there is no SIM card currently available. The back of the phone is very flexible but thin so be careful taking the back off – there is a small piece of tape over the battery connector to make sure the battery is charged before use. There are currently no cases available for the phone so be careful when handling it, overall, I’m very happy with the phone. It does everything that I need it to do and is an affordable alternative to shopping at the store (where its more expensive). It supports many apps, its a mobile hotspot, Youtube, Facebook, emails, messaging, Bluetooth, music, and more!Pros:• Affordability• Functionality (Wifi + Data)• Can be used on most carriers• Huge screen• Front and back flash• Quad core processor• Comes with a screen protector and clear case• Large font optionsCons:• Lack of cases and accessories for the phone• Camera quality could be improved• Support for 4G would be nice• Very slight sound distortion when using speakers all the way up for musicI would definitely repurchase this, it is perfect for my mother who uses her phone at work and to message on Facebook.I received this item for free in exchange for an honest, unbiased, and authentic review. I have thoroughly tested any product I review - I take pride in informing potential customers about the perks and flaws of products. I have no affiliation with the seller and am not obligated to leave a positive review.\n",

      " 5.5\" Phone Unlocked Dual Sim Quad Core-JUNING Android 5.1 Cellphone Blue arrived in good condition and good packaging.I am so excited to finally receive this cell phone, it will be a gift for my nephew back home. Once I received it, I immediately began to charge it and was able to start the phone successfully. The operating system works perfectly and all the necessary updates make for fast and smooth operation. The camera is very powerful and produces excellent pictures. The built in microphone is very good and records audio very clearly. The video record and playback function is seamless and smooth. I also like the size of the phone and it has a good solid feel and weight. This cell phone came with a screen protector already installed and additional screen protectors in the package. This cell phone is very easy to use. I especially like having a dual sim option so that I can have a my work phone number be separate from personal number. This phone is very affordable and looks great!I love this cell phone and would absolutely recommend it to anyone.I received this cell phone at a reduced or discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.\n",

      " Phone looks very nice, with a note equivilent hd screen. The OS is android 5.1, I am unsure if android 6.x is supported. Device has a light duty, slightly flimsy case, you will need to be careful taking it on and off as you could crack it while doing so. It also comes with a screen protector pre-applied so all you have to do is take the plastic bit off of the front and the screen protector is good to go. All of the software on the phone works fine, it has wifi, bluetooth, and sim signal. It has spots for 2 sim cards and 1 sd card, which will be great as an international phone if you plan on going out of the country. cameras both work fine, not super high MP but nothing to be worried about if a phone is your main camera. The phone is fast and I haven't had any trouble running basic apps over wifi like web browsers of facebook app. Basic games seem to work fine as well and run without a hitch. No downside that I can see outside of not being 4g/lte capable. Great phone for the price. Would love to get another one from same seller for my mother.I have received the item at a discounted price in exchange of my honest and unbiased review.\n",

      "This phone is very good for daily use like calling, texting, social media or net surfing. It's fast and the big 5.5\" inch screen is making things on the screen bigger and easy to read. I've been using this mainly for watching Youtube. My son loves using this as the screen is way bigger as compared to my iPhone 5C.This also came with a screen protector and a clear case that's a little gray in color. It is a dual sim card phone and you can also put an SD card inside the phone if you want to expand the memory.The only downside of this phone is the lack of internal space memory. I can't freely download anything I want into this phone because there's not enough space and right now I don't have a spare SD card to use for this phone. I really wish that for a nice phone like this, they should just make this an 8GB memory space rather than 4GB.Over all, this phone works as expected. For the price it's fair and a good size Android phone to have especially if you like YouTube or watch videos online.\n",

When she received it, the charging cable was too loose and the device would NOT accept a charge. She even tried 3 or 4 other charging cables, none of them worked on this device. In addition, when she tried to insert her SIM card (from old phone), the card fell into the slot and she had to fish it out with a needle. This task took a long time to finish.

      "I needed to replace my cellphone. My cellphone that I have had for 3 years wasn't a smart phone, just regular. I looked around and studied and found this was the best low priced unlocked smart phone. I can use it on WiFi to play games and browse. I use the cellphone strictly for calls and texts. I haven't tried it for texting, but I find it works wonderfully for calls. I had to re-learn how to make and receive calls, since this is the first time I have used a smart phone. I have an android tablet that I enjoy so I find this android smartphone to be handy to take with me if I want to browse on WiFi when I am away from home. I used to take the tablet and the cellphone with me when I went out. Now they are combined in one unit. This android cellphone/tablet is slow for a quad-core OS. I guess it is the .5 G of RAM that limits how fast it goes. I am satisfied with it however, and bring a lithium battery pack along to plug into the smartphone when the battery gets low and I want to play games or browse.\n",

      " Android Lollipop on a budget. This phone is great. It keeps the pre-installed apps at a minimum but gives you what you need at the same time. I won't list all of the specs of the phone here as you can see them on the product page. But I will tell you that this is a nice looking phone, it has smooth features and doesn't feel cheap. The camera is awesome, front and rear facing cameras too. The screen on this is clear and responsive to touch. I have owned many phones and this has the functionality of the higher end phones without the price tag. This is actually less expensive than most deductibles on phone insurance policies and then they give you a refurbished phone anyway. Checkout the pictures and video for more details on the user experience. The image of the two phones show the Juning (white) next to an iPhone 5 (black) for comparison.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.\n",

      " So i got this Juning phone 3 days ago, and i started using it already, and i have no complains about this phone. Everything works well, i downloaded music as well and the built in speaker is super clear. As you can see it or hear on my video. You be the judge. Not just that, the apps works perfectly fine. And also before i forget, one thing that i ,ove about thins phone also is that it has BUILT in TORCH flashlight app already which we can use if or when there's a block out on a certain place that needs light.The quality of this JUNING phone is great i could not ask for more. Everything that i wrote and you've seen in the video is all true. Everything i say on my review is based on my personal experience for days that i have been using this juning phone. And lastly i will personally recommend this product to my family and friends. Its user friendly very easy to operate and Its really a great phone and its worth of your money as well too.I got this phone for free in return only of my honest and unbiased review of this product, I am writing what I experienced and only based of my experience, while using the JUNING PHONE. I would just like to thank sophie also, you are one of kind.\n",

      " This phone is pretty neat. For the price, it’s impressive – especially because it is unlocked and can be used with any carrier that has a large SIM card. This phone does not support 4G LTE internet, but does support 3G. This only means that the internet is a tad slower than some other phones that support 4G. It operates much like other android/google phones that I have come into contact with. It features a quad core processor, 1GB RAM, a 2.0 megapixel front camera and 5.0 megapixel back camera. It also includes dual flash, one on the front and one on the back which is pretty impressive. Wifi is enabled and it can be run off the wifi at home if there is no SIM card currently available. The back of the phone is very flexible but thin so be careful taking the back off – there is a small piece of tape over the battery connector to make sure the battery is charged before use. There are currently no cases available for the phone so be careful when handling it, overall, I’m very happy with the phone. It does everything that I need it to do and is an affordable alternative to shopping at the store (where its more expensive). It supports many apps, its a mobile hotspot, Youtube, Facebook, emails, messaging, Bluetooth, music, and more!Pros:• Affordability• Functionality (Wifi + Data)• Can be used on most carriers• Huge screen• Front and back flash• Quad core processor• Comes with a screen protector and clear case• Large font optionsCons:• Lack of cases and accessories for the phone• Camera quality could be improved• Support for 4G would be nice• Very slight sound distortion when using speakers all the way up for musicI would definitely repurchase this, it is perfect for my mother who uses her phone at work and to message on Facebook.I received this item for free in exchange for an honest, unbiased, and authentic review. I have thoroughly tested any product I review - I take pride in informing potential customers about the perks and flaws of products. I have no affiliation with the seller and am not obligated to leave a positive review.\n"

      " This phone is a very pretty looking phone. It offers a slim profile however still great battery length. The quality is great. I was really satisfied with both the video and sound the phone offers. I have to say the color of the phone is one of my favorite features. It's not a tacky gold color. It don't appear cheap. It's actually more of a flat yet metallic look. The phone is very comfortable to hold and definitely isn't heavy. The battery, sim card slot, and SD slot are very easy to access and use. For me, this is very beneficial as I have to swap batteries often since I have to be on mobile web many hours a day. I often have to store photos and files on the SD cards for work. I also flip my sim cards between phones for work as well. This phone made things more convenient for me. The next favorite feature is the hot spot and tethering. I tether often with work and home life. I live in a town where the internet is very slow, and when I turn my tethering on, I can accomplish all my tasks faster than if I had just used my home wifi. The phone comes preloaded with both apps and quick load tabs. If your a busy person on the run like I am, these features are lifesavers. I often have to swap back and forth between four apps, and use many internet pages all day long. The fast tabs stop you from typing in URLs incorrectly. This phone helps me in both my personal and work life. The phone holds signal better than the prepaid phone I use. The battery life seems to last longer as well. I really enjoy this phone. I've enclosed a video to see the features of the phone. I would recommend this phone. I received this phone for free or at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest opinion.\n",

      "Let me begin by saying that this is a wonderful cellphone. I was just impressed with all the quality, features and capabilities that it has. It's very comparable to leading Smartphones and IOS in the market today but at a reasonable price. When i opened the box, it contained all the accessories i need for the cellphone, you name it USB charger, manual, battery pack, headphones and also has extra case and screen protector that normally won't be included when you buy other cellphones. I love that it has dual camera, 2MP on the front and 5MP on back. This smartphone has all the features you would want like camera, messaging, bluetooth capability, WIFI, clock, calculator, wallpapers, calendar, email, GPS, FM, 3G and most of all can download tons of apps in the Play Store. I got the white color and just loves it, very light and thin, it downloads apps quickly, has very responsive touchscreen as well. I received this Smartphone at discount for an honest and unbiased review. All my reviews are completely my own and are based on my overall personal experience using the product. I leave reviews to help other customers make good buying decisions. I definitely would recommend this cellphone. What an excellent buy for what you get all in the package, plus it's unlocked so you can use it with any GSM providers. Not to mention it also has dual sim card slot and with great coverage. I'm very pleased with my new cellphone. It's definitely an Awesome buy!!!\n",

      " This phone is a very pretty looking phone. It offers a slim profile however still great battery length. The quality is great. I was really satisfied with both the video and sound the phone offers. I have to say the color of the phone is one of my favorite features. It's not a tacky gold color. It don't appear cheap. It's actually more of a flat yet metallic look. The phone is very comfortable to hold and definitely isn't heavy. The battery, sim card slot, and SD slot are very easy to access and use. For me, this is very beneficial as I have to swap batteries often since I have to be on mobile web many hours a day. I often have to store photos and files on the SD cards for work. I also flip my sim cards between phones for work as well. This phone made things more convenient for me. The next favorite feature is the hot spot and tethering. I tether often with work and home life. I live in a town where the internet is very slow, and when I turn my tethering on, I can accomplish all my tasks faster than if I had just used my home wifi. The phone comes preloaded with both apps and quick load tabs. If your a busy person on the run like I am, these features are lifesavers. I often have to swap back and forth between four apps, and use many internet pages all day long. The fast tabs stop you from typing in URLs incorrectly. This phone helps me in both my personal and work life. The phone holds signal better than the prepaid phone I use. The battery life seems to last longer as well. I really enjoy this phone. I've enclosed a video to see the features of the phone. I would recommend this phone. I received this phone for free or at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest opinion.\n",

      "Let me begin by saying that this is a wonderful cellphone. I was just impressed with all the quality, features and capabilities that it has. It's very comparable to leading Smartphones and IOS in the market today but at a reasonable price. When i opened the box, it contained all the accessories i need for the cellphone, you name it USB charger, manual, battery pack, headphones and also has extra case and screen protector that normally won't be included when you buy other cellphones. I love that it has dual camera, 2MP on the front and 5MP on back. This smartphone has all the features you would want like camera, messaging, bluetooth capability, WIFI, clock, calculator, wallpapers, calendar, email, GPS, FM, 3G and most of all can download tons of apps in the Play Store. I got the white color and just loves it, very light and thin, it downloads apps quickly, has very responsive touchscreen as well. I received this Smartphone at discount for an honest and unbiased review. All my reviews are completely my own and are based on my overall personal experience using the product. I leave reviews to help other customers make good buying decisions. I definitely would recommend this cellphone. What an excellent buy for what you get all in the package, plus it's unlocked so you can use it with any GSM providers. Not to mention it also has dual sim card slot and with great coverage. I'm very pleased with my new cellphone. It's definitely an Awesome buy!!!\n",

      "Decent price for a decent piece of equipment. The camera is not bad, the processor is decent. What absolutely ruins this phone is the ADWARE GARBAGE attached to it.The Adware does NOTHING (because the ads themselves aren't even sized properly you don't even know what's being promoted) but slows up the phone. It pops up every so often in settings, launching aps etc. Additionally having used close to a dozen MTK phones Lenovo did a poor job of altering the android OS. It's hard to use, not configurable and clunky.And finally I cannot figure out how to change the MMS settings to consolidate group texts - a known problem with earlier generation android phones.I think those that have the time (I don't) to root this phone will have a much better experience. In stock software form it's not better than the other Android phones on the market - despite the slightly lower price.\n",

      "Excellent phone for the price, dual sim, unlocked, with Google Play store. I even got CWM custom recovery to install on it and now I can experiment with other firmware. Please note that most of the CWM installation instruction will NOT work because they were written for the wrong version of the phone. This is the so called 发哥版, you would need to know a bit of Chinese and find the right CWM image for it.The resolution is of course on the low side for such a big phone. On the other hand, I purchased it for my mother and configured it with huge fonts in any case, so it didn't bother me.\n",

I recently purchased a POSH 5.7 phone that was horrible. Very sluggish and froze. This phone however is very fast is comparison. The phone I was trying to replace with these recent purchases was the Samsung G 3. It was a great phone but after two years and many falls needed to be replaced. This Lenovo feels and looks of the same quality, unlike the POSH. I highly recommend it! I will keep this updated if I encounter any problems.\n",

      "This is the second smartphone I purchased (my first one is the same phone, in black). After my experience with my 1st Lenovo A850, I realize that the cheapest price does not mean the phone is best setup to fit my use. I got this one from PriceAngels. Before I placed my order, I confirmed with the seller on setting the language to English, rooting and installing GooglePlay. The seller was very prompt in getting back to me. For that, I thank you!The phone's screen quality is good (although not as high end as HD) for the price level. The touch response is as good as any high end smartphones. Since this phone has been rooted, I could install any app/tools I want.things for Lenovo A850 should be noted (for good reasons) --1. The FM radio is very clear. You cannot use the FM radio on speaker, you must use an ear piece.2. This phone has a built in GPS. I installed a GPS app that does not need internet connection to the phone. The GPS app has slow responses, so, it is hard to tell how good is the GPS until I try some more. If non-web GPS app works well, then I do not have to use DATA for direction at all. For now, my GPS device will remain in the car...3. Although the phone's language has been set to English, some status updates / indicators on the phone are still in Chinese. This does not bother me. I don't think you can have EVERYTHING set to English or another language.4. The phone boots up to some Chinese mobile company. This is one setting I would love to change but don't know how.This phone still gets 5-star rating from me. This is a great phone and the price is great.\n",

      "Had very high expectations for this phone. I was coming from a galaxy s3. Out of the box I liked the look and feel of it. Turned it on and didn't mind the little bit of Chinese or Japanese writing that still lingerd. Put my sim card in and it powered up fine. Problems started when texting. After about 30texts it stopped displaying new texts. I would get notifications saying I had one but when I went to contact to view it wouldn't allow me to scroll to see them. Then the phone would be on silent mode even if I had selected other wise so I couldn't hear when I received texts. Turned the volume up full and it still didn't work. Next was the internet. Wi-Fi connection was fine when at home or work when it had a network to connect to but not while using AT&T network (my carrier). Tried everything and got somewhat close. Sometimes it would work briefly. After loading for a few minutes a page might display but if you tried to click on a link or the next page it would say no network connection. So no internet on the go or GPS.Also if you were sent a link in a text from a friend or colleague the phone said it didn't have the correct program to continue and wouldn't connect. All in all the phone was just SO GLITCHEY! Every day something new would pop up. Even if the internet worked I just didn't feel safe having this phone as my source of contact to the world, like it would crash at any moment. My s3 just blew this phone away. Even if everything worked right it still didn't stack up. The big screen was nice but not as clear as my S3, and it was so freaking slow loading movies and pictures and web pages.I recommend avoiding this phone and looking into something else. Pay more and get something more reliable.\n",

      "To keep it short Ill just say:This review is two parts - the 1st - this phone is amazing. Feels like 10K, looks like 10K, fast and clean. Benefits are there are MANY MANY roms to flash very easily. The phone feels like something you would want to own!The second - I RETURNED IT :-( . First is that you MUST check the ROM kernel. If it does not say \"ROW\" in the file name you will have a headache. Just that simple. But the most important is in does NOT run on the 850MHZ in 3G/HSPDA+. I repeat it is not a 850mhz Penta Band phone in upper bands. What does this mean for you? ATT, TMobile, and MVNOs (straight talk, ect) that run on these networks will ONLY GIVE YOU 2G speeds which are to be disbanded shortly. Very few places, mostly big cities, operate that 2100mhz in USA. So if you want it for USA - sad to say - we are gonna miss out on this one.I give it 4 stars for the fact that its a 10 star phone - but CANNOT be run in \"todays\" markets in the USA.Good luck all.NOTE: Purchased twice - 1st was AXOING = NO ROW, Chinese only!; 2nd - was APlusElek = Old Rom but WAS \"ROW\" so easy enough to work with for Google services. BUT NO USA\n",

      "This is my second time buying a cellphone from amazon. As always, i did a heavy research BEFORE buying the phone and placing my order.My first impression of the phone was: Holy crap this is beautiful. Its thin, its slick and it is black and shiny all over the place! It is really something to admire.The first thing is: This phone is HUGE. Its totally a thing. And it wont stop being a thing. I mean it is a 5.5 inch screen, which makes this phone almost a tablet, which it is! so it is called a Phablet. The screen is very bright, crisp, and seriously, IPS? in my opinion the best choice for color and brightness,plus it saves battery. People complains that this phone doesn't have a 1080p screen, but really, if you can see the difference between the pixel density of this phone (aprox 200ppi ) and the pixel density of the iPhone (500 ppi) then your eyes must be better than the Kepler telescope. Go work at NASA or some stuff hehehehe. The screen size alone makes up for some things it is missing, and it totally should have, like a magnetometer. But don't get me wrong. This lil fella here is a powerhouse. It will make some phat rhymes and some ill beats for you if you play it rightThe feel of the phone is sturdy. It wont broke easily (nor i recommend you to try and break it. I mean come on) The back case has a good grip. Still i recommend you to get a phone cover, just in case. TPU will do or something more sturdier. I got one from http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EY7SS72/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1It has a LCD screen cover plus the case!!Inside the box, i got the phone (Durrrrr), Charger, Battery, A screen cover !!, a 4 GB micro SD!! , USB Cable, Wall Adapter And some cool earphones. Really complete set in my opinion. It has the bare minimum to go strolling.The charger is of good quality, sturdy, as is the USB cable and the wall adapter.About the Battery. It is a 2250 mAh battery. Now in the last two weeks i only charged the phone once every 2 days. So that gives you an approximate of 2 days of battery with GPS , WIFI and DATA NETWORK on. But that's me, I don't play much with the phone, and my heavy using apps are social ones. There is an application on the phone called Lenovo Power that manages battery in a smart way so it lasts longer. I suggest to learn it and use it.OK, opening the back case is nothing short of easy. It has a little dent to the lower right side that allows you to pull the back case fast and easy.Inside you will find 2 standard sized SIM CARD slots, Micro SD slot up to 32 GB , Phone Camera, Audio Speakers And battery slot. The phone accepts mini SIM CARDS too. Now about the DUAL SIM you must know that the First one(The one on the left) Is able to Use 3G capabilities while the other one cannot. Don't Sweat it, this is standard practice. The second SIM CARD slot will be and shall be used for a second phone line used only for calls. The audio Speaker is of good Quality. And LOUD. Good lord that thing is noisy hehehe.This phone Id is LENOVO A850. Its not a lenovo A820 and it is totally NOT a SAMSUNG GALAXY 2,3 OR 4. Nevertheless it has a bunch of qualities that will prove quite useful.Why do i mention that you ask? It is because of the camera. I kid you not. Its a 5 MP camera. Its a really good camera, but some People might want this phone to shoot pictures at a quality that is beyond the hardware. The pictures are excellent in my opinion and they will work with whats-app and other apps. It has a lot of modes like continuous shooting and auto-focus and you can set up camera quality up to 5 MP. You can record video at high quality too. It seems 1080p But in fact it is scaled from a lesser resolution. Not a problem for me tho. As always, this is a phone, not a camera.This phone has a MT6582M mediatek CPU. It is a Quad-core@1.3 GHz with a GPU MALI-400MP2. What does this Means for you? Its Fast. Trust Me , really fast. Your multimedia will play with no problems and your games will go like silk. Games like NOVA 3 and Anomaly Korea . Cool.It has 4 GB of internal memory that translates in a total of 2.31 GB in real usable space. It has too 1 GB of ram. This will Make the phone faster too, because you will be multitasking a lot with this Phone .Now going to the front side of the phone, you will find in the top The brand of the phone (LENOVO) in shiny silver letters, your 3.5 Audio Plug, power Button ,speaker, frontal camera , proximity sensor and a notification led . The frontal camera is a 1.2 MP one, it wont transmit lots of data to Skype and other apps so its ideal to make video calls. The top speaker Works like a charm as well as the proximity sensor and the 4 colors notification LED (Blue,Red,Orange,Green). I guess the LED is fully Configurable But haven't tried it yet .I will Update As Possible.In the Bottom you will find 3 silver shiny soft touch buttons, micro USB slot and microphone.The soft Buttons are from left to right:Menu Button, Home Button and Go back Button. They are shiny and silver and they wont have BACK-LIGHT. They will be visible enough in the darkness so that's it.The right side of the phone has the +/- volume buttons. The left side has nothing.OK that's with the Physical stuff. Now we go to Software.First Thing First. This Phone posses a high grade of heavy customization. And as such, it is necessary that if you are going to make use it, you are able to at least, follow instructions precisely and know your way around android OS or a computer. Sorry but that's it if you want to customize it. If not, Then don't worry ! Most Sellers are very kind and they will get you (if you ask them of course) the phone in your language be it Spanish or English or whatevs and they will customize it for you. But seriously, ask them. Don{t expect them to do it just for giggles. And certainly, do not ask after getting the phone or placing the order. Before is OK.The software is a tricky thing. My phone came with a Android 4.2.2 Rom that is called S128 Xiaomijie. It was a Chinese ROM but it came in English. I just wiped it and installed another one called S121, made by Linerty. Its more stable for me. Ill post the links At the end for you all that want to customize the phone.There is a silver lining to this. There is an announce from mediatek that this phone will get android 4.4 KITKAT at the end of this month (18/04/2014 as today) so if you go trough with the ROM change you will get the experience needed to update to KITKAT later. All this will be done manually. Bollocks.Anyways, android 4.2 goes really fast in this phone. Man, so FAST. you will get lot of apps that will make your experience with this phone something worth sharing. Your live wallpapers will be smooth, your wireless will be fast and your calls will always go trough. The android integration is really cool and it will save you lots of trouble when you set up your APN's , because at the time you insert your sim card it will get all the info you need for it.The GPS is really exact. you will get accurate measures up to +/- 2 meters. You wont need a internet connection for it to work. Only when you download your maps but apart from that, no.This phone Works Excellently in Venezuela. It works with Movilnet and Movistar (SIM CARD 1) and with Digitel (SIM CARD 2) . That{s for GSM calls. For 3G and data connection its only the SIM CARD 1.Over all, this phone is a great Purchase. I give it 10/10 points because the sheer awesomeness . Have in mind that this is a mid-end phone.And it kicks some rump.About The Seller. It was LightInTheBox. They sent Directly from China Via DHL. It was a Fast shipment (For me). I communicated with themand they were always attentive and fast at answering. Id go with them again in any case.At The time i bought the Phone it was worth 169$ . I guess it will get cheaper so get it if you can :DOne thing You must remember, This is no Samsung S5/S4 Phone, nor an Iphone, Not a tablet. But it will prove reliable with office applications and such .Have a Nice Day !Thanks For Reading This.-18/04/2014-\n",

I wonder as is the procedure in such cases, if necessary forwarding phones and which direction.Thanking the prompt response to the problems that I present, I say goodbye.Gaudys Fermin.\n",

      "I asked other people questions on Amazon about whether it would work with digi mobil (movistar). Everyone said it would. It required a sim adapter.So now on to my review.Anyone who gives this phone 5 stars has never owned a premium smartphone. For this review I am comparing to my Samsung Galaxy S5Touchscreen: With the factory provided screen protector on, sometimes its unresponsive, sometimes it freezes. I have to hold down on a touch screen button most of the time for the phone to realize its being touched and then less than half the time the button will respond. Take the screen protector off and it works marvelously, but then you risk damaging the screen.Network: Movistar DigiMobil (pay as you go plan) When I got my SIM I bought a Samsung Galaxy Young 2 to use it in. No major issues aside from phone size. In the young 2 my whatsapp worked fine and I could send texts and make phone calls in my whatsapp on only my mobile network no Wifi. Now that my SIM is in the Lenovo, it will not allow me to transmit in whatsapp at all unless connected to wifi.-In addition, there is no Internet or google play access without wifi.This is a s*** phone and is being returned\n",

      "This is my first Android phone. I've only had iPhones up till now but my 4S is starting to show it's age so instead of spending well over $700 for the iPhone 5C I decided to try out Android because I have a Nexus 7 and like it.This Lenovo A850 had the specs I was looking for and the feedback that convinced me to try it out especially since it only cost a little under $160 on Amazon including shipping.Yeah I had to wait for it to be delivered from China but it didn't take all that long. It did have it's caveats like only 4GB memory storage and 2 of that was a MicroSD card, but after swapping it for a 32GB card and flashing it with a cleaner version of Lenovo's iteration of Android 4.2.2, I'm really enjoying the power and responsiveness of this Mediatek processor. The 1GB of RAM seems ample for my general use but I've watched videos of decent gameing handled by it as well. I also like the battery life but that didn't stop me from buying an extra battery and battery charger since I can just swap out batteries making it never really needing to sit and charge unless I want to.Bottom line is if you know your way around Android even if your just a novice like me, you're gonna really like this phone!

The phone is configured to work only in China, even the time/clock on the phone is set to China time zone and you cannot change it. The phone will not accept any changes - you cannot install new apps or make changes to the pre- installed apps - and there are a number of Chinese junk apps pre-installed. The phone will often give you messages in Chinese language. Also, it crashes frequently, and you will get several error messages. It needs to be rebooted frequently. Any changes you made will get lost each time it reboots. Your text messages and contact will even disappear randomly. The battery drains out quickly.

      "Decent price for a decent piece of equipment. The camera is not bad, the processor is decent. What absolutely ruins this phone is the ADWARE GARBAGE attached to it.The Adware does NOTHING (because the ads themselves aren't even sized properly you don't even know what's being promoted) but slows up the phone. It pops up every so often in settings, launching aps etc. Additionally having used close to a dozen MTK phones Lenovo did a poor job of altering the android OS. It's hard to use, not configurable and clunky.And finally I cannot figure out how to change the MMS settings to consolidate group texts - a known problem with earlier generation android phones.I think those that have the time (I don't) to root this phone will have a much better experience. In stock software form it's not better than the other Android phones on the market - despite the slightly lower price.\n",

I use one plan for voice and another for data/text. Or you can use each SIM for different countries services when travelling. The manual and warranty is in Chinese, but it's easy to figure out. It's a phone: Insert battery, Insert SIM, insert micro SD, insert charger cable, charge, tap on Settings. That's pretty much what a quick-start guide will say.The ear buds are cheap.

Some things are still in Chinese although the language was initially set to be English. this seller have not done the right rooting as it described. But that does not prevent me enjoy the phone until now. Its default setting needs to be customized if you use gophone plan. You MUST turn off the data connection service to avoid automatic connecting and charging for the online time (Could be too late when you notice that).I will add more when I learn using other functions.Just find that when you insert 32G SD card, the machine response very slow.

      "This is the second smartphone I purchased (my first one is the same phone, in black). After my experience with my 1st Lenovo A850, I realize that the cheapest price does not mean the phone is best setup to fit my use. I got this one from PriceAngels. Before I placed my order, I confirmed with the seller on setting the language to English, rooting and installing GooglePlay. The seller was very prompt in getting back to me. For that, I thank you!The phone's screen quality is good (although not as high end as HD) for the price level. The touch response is as good as any high end smartphones. Since this phone has been rooted, I could install any app/tools I want.things for Lenovo A850 should be noted (for good reasons) --1. The FM radio is very clear. You cannot use the FM radio on speaker, you must use an ear piece.2. This phone has a built in GPS. I installed a GPS app that does not need internet connection to the phone. The GPS app has slow responses, so, it is hard to tell how good is the GPS until I try some more. If non-web GPS app works well, then I do not have to use DATA for direction at all. For now, my GPS device will remain in the car...3. Although the phone's language has been set to English, some status updates / indicators on the phone are still in Chinese. This does not bother me. I don't think you can have EVERYTHING set to English or another language.4. The phone boots up to some Chinese mobile company. This is one setting I would love to change but don't know how.This phone still gets 5-star rating from me. This is a great phone and the price is great.\n",

I could call and receive calls, and text and receive texts, but none of the data would work, it wouldn't connect to the internet so I couldn't view anything nor download anything. I got an error with everything I tried. So I put my SIM card back in my old phone for now.

The phone I was trying to replace with these recent purchases was the Samsung G 3. It was a great phone but after two years and many falls needed to be replaced.

      "Bought this phone as a factory-refurb. When it arrived, I plugged it in to charge and the splash screen came up... great I thought and walked away. Looked an hr later to check the progress and nothing had changed! No status bar, nothing! This should have been my first indication of trouble. Unplugged, plugged, unplugged, plugged and then the status bar came up...A cool feature is that the phone gives an audible alert when the battery is full! But then it was a witch to get it to turn on! Hold the button, wait for splash screen, wait to see if it initializes... if/when it doesn't, take the back off, take the battery out and start all over... usually 4-5 times before the phone would initialize! At first, I just figured this was a consequence of the battery being completely dead but nope... had to go through this EVERY time the phone was turned off!So I returned it (under the 30 day warranty) and the seller sent a new phone. Great! Well, I couldn't get the new phone past the splash screen no matter what I did!!!So, as far as features once I did get the first phone to work...The music player is really pretty nice! The built-in speakers sound great for a phone! The touch screen is responsive and the phone feels great in your hand! And, the wifi was pretty cool... BUT (and now the bad)... you can't see anything on the screen in direct sunlight! the headphone jack is proprietary. And, there aren't a lot of apps... I mean, even the facebook \"app\" was essentially a bookmark to the FB webpage. For this price point, I wasn't expecting an iPhone but seriously, this phone left a lot to be desired!So, my opinion is that this phone is a POS... 1/2 star for the phone working nicely when it worked, 1/2 star for the features, and 1 star for the music player sounding so great... Don't bother...\n",

Does work with straighttalk bring your own phone (BYOP) packet. You have to use the att or t-mobile sim cards and you HAVE to call the customer service operators so they can do it. They will tell you its not going to work blah blah blah but it does work I ordered two of this phones and they are working perfectly wih 4G. Only bought one BYOP packet--it comes with three different sim cards so it worked for me so I could activate both phones with one packet. After you activate the service then straight talk sends you a txt so you visit a website link and activate your internet: dont worry its very easy to do.When you first get it remember to remove back cover and remove paper from battery so it wont blink when you are charging it.

I usually leave my review after many weeks of using the phone so this post is late.Love the unlocked dual simcard.Pictures quality is decent and clear.cellphone features are great.High resolution.You can use this phone anywhere in the country and you can use this phone outside the country too because it's unlocked.This phone is affordable and it feels like similar to my samsung.The only down side of this phone is that I noticed if you don't use it much the battery won't stay full even you don't use it.But over all this is a great phone for the price and it won't hurt you to buy this and try.Disclamer:I got this phone for free in return to my unbiased review.\n",

      "I have to start out by saying that I really like this phone. I love the 6\" screen. Once you use a 6\" screen, it's really hard to go back smaller. I currently had a 6\" when I received this phone however mine was lacking one feature that I need to have available. That's the hotspot tethering feature. In my line of work, I often end up in places that have no wifi. Which tends to make things difficult for me since I have to be on a computer often. This tethering feature allows me to put my computer on the internet when wifi isn't available as long as I have at least one bar of signal. I have tested out and love this feature as much if not more than the screen size. It's really easy to turn on and off as well.The phone has all my needs that I have to use daily already preset in it. Not only that, but the phone is capable of taking screenshots. There are still many phones that don't offer that option. This feature i use at least 50 times a day.I often listen to music and love that YouTube is readily available. On the home screen if the phone, it comes with a built in radio app. The radio app isn't the greatest but how can you complain, after all you have a radio available everyday all day long. The phone also has the Google play store preinstalled which allows you to add other music apps such as Pandora.The Google play store allows you to download games, videos, and all sorts of apps. Many if them are free of charge.I travel a lot in the evening hours and find myself using flashlights often. However, you ever tried opening a door while holding your keys, phone, and flashlight? Ya, it's hard. This phone is preloaded with the torch app which is a flashlight.Pictures is another feature i have to use daily for work, but I also take lots of pictures in my personal life. This has both front and rear facing cameras. The rear has a flash. The phone comes preloaded with a cool app that has special features for editing photos. Including the smart shot and beauty app.Can't forget to mention the clock, calendar, and calculater apps. I often have to rely on my phone as an alarm clock on the road. I have to use a calendar daily to remember all my appointments. The calculator app is also high important as I am constantly dealing with money.This phone comes with dual sim card slots. I love the idea that it can be used anywhere in the world. It's also a unlocked phone so you can put it on almost any carrier. I use a prepaid carrier. Another bonus is that you can put a micro SD card in there to expand the memory.Overall, this phone is a great phone. It actually has suited all the needs I have on a daily basis. The picture and sound quality is good. You can pick up wifi range further than a lot of phones I've had in the past. It comes ready to be used. It's packed securely and the package is discreet. I would recommend this phone. I received this phone free or at a discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion.\n",

      "'JUNING SMARTPHONE C5Color: GoldSize: 6.0\"I been wanting to have a new smartphone that has a bigger screen size compared to what I have right now, so I feel lucky to have this one. It comes with Manual, battery charger/USB, earphone, clear casing that fit so right and not bulky at all. Juning Unlocked Smartphone 6.0 C5 exceeded my expectations, the phone is well made and looks expensive, and so since I love to take selfie's I immediately tried the 'camera front and back, I am impressed! I had low expectations having 2.2 MP camera front and back, I thought the camera quality resolution will be bad and I'll say I am very wrong. The picture quality is decent clear, it takes a good selfies' and 'videos, I super love it, now I can take selfies anywhere I go. There's a plus for me using camera selfie of this phone, because I don't have to download picture editor or camera360 etc., it comes with it! already ready to use, just simple take your selfie, click makeup in the bottom right side of the screen then holla, there yah go, you can now beautify yourself without downloading any apps, that just saved memory storage.''''''What I like also is for 6\" smartphone it is very light to carry around, with that said I can now leave my iPad at home and just carry my Juning Smartphone C5 6\" with me, because of the size it is like having 2in1, phone and tablet at the same time which is cool. If you have small hand like me' you need to use to hands while using it. ^____^Juning Smartphone 6.0\" is unlocked phone so you can use GSM/WCDMA SIM card, it is not compatible for CDMA SIM card so be aware of that before you buy SIM card, it is good for roaming sim card number, I can now use sim card to text and call my family back home in PH.The phone is nice and clear, looks like HD. Phone storage is 4 GB, up to 16 GB, so I slot my memory card for more storage memory. I was thinking buying bigger memory card like 16GB so that I don't have to worry of getting low of memory specially storing my pictures and apps. 'The phone sound is clear, makes me enjoy listening music' '''. In regard of Battery Life, Probably won't last too long if you use it constantly with full brightness, as I experienced the phone was full since 7am in the morning,I go to work using phone, got home 5:30pm and still have battery life, that is without using it too much. It don't really bother me since I have one power bank with me all the time in case I need it. And if you want to stretch the battery life longer, you can always lower down the brightness of the display. I must say if you use too much phone, you may consider buying extra battery or power bank to be with you, Juning also have Power bank portable external battery charger with smart charger technology for affordable price, check that out.'I am using my phone often using Facebook, Instagram, listening music, watching videos and of course taking selfies/pictures, sometimes the app crashed which is natural for me, same to my old phone and even my iPad crashed too, so that's not a problem. Also, sometimes it seems phone freezing or slow down, but not a problem for me anymore, just search Mr. Google what to do, how to make android phone faster and boom problem solved. :) I don't play games right now because I don't have time for that at this moment so I can't rate that part using this phone. Connecting to wifi was fast and easy, downloading some apps with no problem.Overall for the price under $100 with 6\" screen, I can't complain! It's not the best phone out there compared to branded expensive smartphone that will cost you $$$$, and with that said without breaking your bank and still have nice 6\" smartphone.' Juning Unlocked smartphone 6.0\" C5 is perfectly right for me, I already felt like I am having a iPhone 6s.Also, Juning has a great customer service. Thank you Ms Sophie you're one of a kind.Purchased this phone for free except for the shipping and handling, this phone was like for testing in return of my honest review of this product, i am only writing what i experienced, noticed while using this phone.Pictures and video will be uploaded on my next update.'I will update once i noticed something different.\n",

It went dead one day and after he put it on the Charger it still wouldn't turn back on....then mine broke about a month after my purchase, the busted on it with very minor impact , for example like putting it in my purse and just walking around. With it for a couple of hours.... I continued to use it with a busted screen BC I couldn't afford. Repairs and finally about six months. After my purchases it finally knocked. Off and died too....and what little time it did work it would constantly go dead took hours to charge would die within3 mins and never had a bit of working. Speed....it always ran slow ands would ffreeze up. Final thought, I wasted over 400$ on these. Phones and. I could have gotten better use out of a little toy phone then this phone!

      "This is an amazing Android phone. Very well-made. The price has been going up and down like a yoyo, though. Two weeks after I ordered it, there was a US$19 drop. The vendor has kindly promised to send an additional battery to make it up. Service from this vendor (lol-buy) is quite good. No complaints here.There is already a very helpful and somewhat long review thread on the orange version. I'll simply touch upon two major issues here:(1) The sim cards: I have tried an AT&T data plan micro-sim (an adapter is needed), booted up the phone and the card is recognized. After entering info in the sim management panel, 3G service is indicated by an H next to the signal bars. No problems answering and calling at all. Then a second sim from another country is tested, also recognized right away; although a field test will have to be deferred until my next overseas trip.(2) The GPS: It actually works well. A Satellite Check app (also included in the Polaris Navigation app) operating in the magnetic mode (for indoor use) picks up 9-12 satellites in a few minutes. It takes only seconds to get a fix outdoors. Google Navigation works flawlessly.On the flip side, the display is no retina display; it is just good enough for general viewing. And some apps don't work - those requiring a magnetic sensor (it does not have one), for example, the compass apps. Not deal breakers, of course.Overall, for the money, this is a surprisingly good smartphone. Some tweaking is needed, but it is part of the fun.5/13/2013 Update: (1) The vendor quickly sent over the battery. (2) After many tries, this phone simply cannot be rooted.6/4/2013 Update: This phone actually can be rooted. Now it is perfect!7/19/2013: After almost 3 months of daily use, this phone is still going strong. There has been a huge improvement, thanks to Google. The newest Google Maps no longer stays in RAM thus avoiding the previous version's eating up the memory.8/15/2013: After inserting a new battery, all of a sudden, the phone begins to randomly shut down, does not wake up from sleep, cannot fully reboot, and worse, the battery cannot be re-charged. Turns out to be a contact issue: the three copper pins on the battery and the phone sometimes do not kiss tightly. The battery needs to be about 0.1-0.2mm longer. A spacer made from aluminum foil corrects the problems. These symptoms are suspiciously similar to some previous comments complaining about a broken phone or unchargeable battery. Probably just a loose connection.3/3/2014: After testing umpteen apps. Two prove the most useful: (1) a browser with a funny name \"Naked Browser\" allows automatic deletion of history, cache, etc, on exit; and (2) MobileUncle is a must, in its Engineering -> localization mode, a GPS fix can be obtained in less than 18 sec. Others such as Documents-to-Go works well with Dropbox and phone calls, both US and international, with Viber is a breeze. This dual core phone still does a good job, it'll be interesting to see if the ones with octacore will now take over.\n",

Its pretty fast i get signal everywhere. the only thing is if you use straight talk you cant recieve pics. their apn doesnt unlock pics.. but on the plus side i didn't realize when i bought it you can take screen shots when holding down the volume button & the power button at the same time.everything works great . im glad i got this phone its a good deal for the price\n",

      "First off, great service as usual. I wanted a small Windows Phone and had seen this phone at the MS store. I liked the look, and thought it would work. First off, there are no directions for inserting the SIM card. Why would you need directions you ask? Because after ten minutes of dinking with it I realized that SIM1 on this phone is a \"full-size\" SIM card! Who has those anymore? So, I had to put my SIM card in the SIM2 slot. When I did that, every call I made required me to select SIM2 over SIM1. Also, it was taking way to long for all my apps to load. Ridiculously too long. But the nail in the coffin for this phone was the screen. It's awful. You have to tilt the phone just right to see the screen clearly. Just a little angle from any direction and it like your looking through one of those PC security screens from the 80's. One other reason I was interested in the phone was the textured case; I thought it would be easier to grip. Not. It's slipperier than the smooth case on my Lumina 635, which I'd use all the time if it had a front facing camera. Anyway, if any on you know of a good Windows phone with a 4\" screen I'd appreciate your feedback.\n",

      "UPDATED....After 1 month....this is still a great phone. This is replacing my Galaxy S5. I also have an iPhone 6 which I use for work. I have also used the HTC ONE X+, HTC M9, LG G3, Moto G3 and Honor 5X. The Idol 4S is a great phone, it is very thin and has a beautiful build. Battery life has been great....easily 12+ hours, waaaaaay longer if you're not killing it with games all day. Stand by/idol time is amazing. Total \"screen on time\" for me is around 4-1/2 hours with checking emails, texting, you tube, reading news, music, some casual gaming (examples: SSG3, SkyForce reloaded, Words, Fieldrunners 2, Smash Hit, Defense Zone 3) for a total of 12+ hours use. It also recharges very fast. The display is AWESOME...even outside in the sun is no problem. Better than all of the above mentioned phones. Not sure if the screen is gorilla glass...I have no scratches yet and I don't use a screen protector. I've watched many reviews of this phone before buying. Most of them complain about the fingerprint scanner. There is really nothing wrong with it. It is very comparable in speed to my iPhone 6 and registers the same number of times....about 98% of the time. I actually think its a little better than the iPhone 6 fingerprint scanner. The sound is awesome on this phone whether you use headphones or not. I have not had any issues with AT&T cell signal, GPS, or bluetooth. No problem with bluetooth connecting to my car or my home A/V receiver. I ALWAYS use Nova Launcher on every Android phone in my family, and the Idol 4S is no exception. This phone with the 652 processor and 3 gig ram handles everything easily. The phone runs super smooth...no lagging. And this phone comes with decent JBL headphones, screen protector, and VR headset (VR is pretty cool). Overall a great buy but I think $350 might be a better price. It's a definite buy either way. You will not be disappointed.\n",

      "I broke my Iphone 6 plus and I was not willing to pay $750+++ for a new Apple phone. I have to admit I was a little leery of this phone given the fact that I am a long time Apple user. After some careful research I decided on the Alcatel IDOL 4S. It is much more affordable and still delivers the high end experience I was looking for. So far I am extremely happy with the purchase and would highly recommend anyone to give this phone a shot. In terms of speed my IDOL 4S is noticeably faster on the web in the same environment as my Iphone 6 plus. In terms of battery I could barely get through half a day on my Iphone with heavy use. My IDOL 4S ends the day with between 30% and 40% of power left with the same kind of usage. When you do need to charge it has some technology that charges the phone super fast called “quick charge 2.0”. I take a ton of pictures with my phone and I love the fact that this phone offers a flash on the front and rear sides of the phone. The ability to expand the memory on the phone with a micro SD card is a huge plus to me because I keep so many pictures on my phone. I rarely listen to music through my phone's internal speakers, however this phone has two speakers on it! (One on the top of the phone and one on the bottom.) I compared it to my iphone and it's a huge difference. You get a surround sound affect and it is much louder than any of my other phones. I haven't tried out the VR googles yet, but the JBL headphones that come with it are surprisingly good quality. Alcatel also throws in a screen protector, making this phone a complete package. I am an AT&T customer and they have an app called \"AT&T mobile transfer\" that literally takes minutes to transfer all your contacts, videos, and pictures from your original device to your new device. So easy to use and it doesn't matter if you are going from Apple to Android based. 5 stars across the board, VERY satisfied customer!\n",

      "UPDATED....After 1 month....this is still a great phone. This is replacing my Galaxy S5. I also have an iPhone 6 which I use for work. I have also used the HTC ONE X+, HTC M9, LG G3, Moto G3 and Honor 5X. The Idol 4S is a great phone, it is very thin and has a beautiful build. Battery life has been great....easily 12+ hours, waaaaaay longer if you're not killing it with games all day. Stand by/idol time is amazing. Total \"screen on time\" for me is around 4-1/2 hours with checking emails, texting, you tube, reading news, music, some casual gaming (examples: SSG3, SkyForce reloaded, Words, Fieldrunners 2, Smash Hit, Defense Zone 3) for a total of 12+ hours use. It also recharges very fast. The display is AWESOME...even outside in the sun is no problem. Better than all of the above mentioned phones. Not sure if the screen is gorilla glass...I have no scratches yet and I don't use a screen protector. I've watched many reviews of this phone before buying. Most of them complain about the fingerprint scanner. There is really nothing wrong with it. It is very comparable in speed to my iPhone 6 and registers the same number of times....about 98% of the time. I actually think its a little better than the iPhone 6 fingerprint scanner. The sound is awesome on this phone whether you use headphones or not. I have not had any issues with AT&T cell signal, GPS, or bluetooth. No problem with bluetooth connecting to my car or my home A/V receiver. I ALWAYS use Nova Launcher on every Android phone in my family, and the Idol 4S is no exception. This phone with the 652 processor and 3 gig ram handles everything easily. The phone runs super smooth...no lagging. And this phone comes with decent JBL headphones, screen protector, and VR headset (VR is pretty cool). Overall a great buy but I think $350 might be a better price. It's a definite buy either way. You will not be disappointed.\n",

      "I broke my Iphone 6 plus and I was not willing to pay $750+++ for a new Apple phone. I have to admit I was a little leery of this phone given the fact that I am a long time Apple user. After some careful research I decided on the Alcatel IDOL 4S. It is much more affordable and still delivers the high end experience I was looking for. So far I am extremely happy with the purchase and would highly recommend anyone to give this phone a shot. In terms of speed my IDOL 4S is noticeably faster on the web in the same environment as my Iphone 6 plus. In terms of battery I could barely get through half a day on my Iphone with heavy use. My IDOL 4S ends the day with between 30% and 40% of power left with the same kind of usage. When you do need to charge it has some technology that charges the phone super fast called “quick charge 2.0”. I take a ton of pictures with my phone and I love the fact that this phone offers a flash on the front and rear sides of the phone. The ability to expand the memory on the phone with a micro SD card is a huge plus to me because I keep so many pictures on my phone. I rarely listen to music through my phone's internal speakers, however this phone has two speakers on it! (One on the top of the phone and one on the bottom.) I compared it to my iphone and it's a huge difference. You get a surround sound affect and it is much louder than any of my other phones. I haven't tried out the VR googles yet, but the JBL headphones that come with it are surprisingly good quality. Alcatel also throws in a screen protector, making this phone a complete package. I am an AT&T customer and they have an app called \"AT&T mobile transfer\" that literally takes minutes to transfer all your contacts, videos, and pictures from your original device to your new device. So easy to use and it doesn't matter if you are going from Apple to Android based. 5 stars across the board, VERY satisfied customer!\n",

Mine one used to restart during phone conversations. Contact and other applicaions give error and I have to close them. Alarm mode does not works. If I try a phone call it takes long to beep or dialing. Not factory unlocked to uninstall app not needed. I had the first model and GPS works great, this one not. So I would not recomend this model. The big problem looks like to be a model manufactured exclusively for T-Mobil and Metro PCS. If they are used out from USA there are not posibilities to update when updates are available. I have done root and any how the same problem with update. My last problem at the time.\n",

If I try a phone call it takes long to beep or dialing. Not factory unlocked to uninstall app not needed. I had the first model and GPS works great, this one not. So I would not recomend this model.

      "Review after 4 days:Pro:-Speakers are bananas-Pulling down the top bar shows a quick preview. Pull down again to show more settings.-Speakers on both sides (on top and bottom).-Battery is fantastic upon buying (great once you start downloading apps). Usually, l phones drain at an average rate and then at 20% it magically drops to 0 in no time. This drains slowly without magical drops even when I have WiFi on and using Spotify and pinterest at the same time at 4%. Good stuff.-Less bloatware: Avg antivirus, Facebook, twitter, chrome, drive, google+, hangouts, weather, WiFi transfer, adobe reader, (NFC) tags, radio, WiFi display, YouTube.-Design of app buttons - not outdated looking.-Pros say the display is meh but it looks good to me.-Double tap screen to wake up. Good if laying flat so you don't have to pick up to press power button.-Don't need to sign in password to access basic pull down settings.-If your phone dies, all the apps open when you turn on, like a computer. Nice-You can uninstall factory apps that are not run by Google. Deleted FB and Twitter, but can't delete YouTube. (Almost) for the win.Meh:-Music: songs overlap 5 secs so you know what song is next.-Camera is acceptable.-Option to pick up in any orientation. I don't need this feature but if your oober lazy/clumsy I guess this could work for you.-Power button is on left and volume is on right. Weird but okay.-Quick access to certain buttons when wake up from sleep like camera, messages, etc.Con:-UI is not intuitive like Apple/Samsung.-Lacks a lot of settings options. No universal settings button like on Samsung.-There's no main home page like on Samsung; when you press the home button, it goes to the last page you were on.-Design of buttons: instead of a backwards play button for 'go back' it is an upside down triangle. Home is a circle instead of a house. Showing all open apps is a square. As a designer, this bugs me because they have no correlation...unless they do corrolate in China.-A sealed battery.-Bottom button bar takes up far too much space and makes screen smaller.-Have to tap each text to the time stamp.-About 4 hrs after unboxing, checked music settings and pressing a song to play in library, it often skips over that song. Sometimes over 1, sometimes as much as six. O thought maybe it was the file type but if you press the backward button (next to pause, not the main), or select play next in queue and press fast forward, it will play. Annoying. Hopefully putting the songs I want into playlists will solve this, unless it skips those too.All in all, acceptable for under $200 compared to iPhone and samsung. I mean really, we are all spoiled. All you really need is call, text, and camera. Use a tablet or computer for all the app bull. Would still rather my SG-S4 because of the user interface, but I get what I need here. (My S4 just up and died on me. Won't turn on. Survived for 3 wks without it)\n",

      "I know this may sound funny to many people, but this phone reminds me a lot of iPhone 6. They both have similar dimension and the same screen size. The Idol 3's build quality is very good and it just doesn't feel like a budget phone. I absolutely love the screen for its resolution and color. This came from someone who have used LG G4 and Motorola Moto X and Moto G. This phone is not the fastest out there but it is smooth enough for every day use. I didn't experience any delay so far unlike BLU Life One 4G LTE (2015) which I returned for sluggish performance. I would recommend Alcatel ONETOUCH IDOL 3 4.7\" to anyone who doesn't like all those huge 5.5\" phones out there but rather has a small easy to handle phone.\n",

      "Lasted less than a month.I went to sleep one night with the phone on the included USB charger. When I woke up, I noticed it was glitching very badly between my PIN lock screen and the home screen dashboard. My touches did not register. I couldn't even make it go into a hard reset.Fast forward one hour later -- it had stopped holding a charge. The phone died pretty hard and at a time I was least expecting it.Fast forward some more -- I attempt to RMA the phone. Their website isn't very intuitive when it comes to finding a repair center. Eventually I find their US repair center. I start filling out the forms, but then I realized I couldn't grab my phone's IMEI and chalked it up as a $175+ loss. Fortunately I have the budget to grab a new phone, but that's still a lot of money to spend on a phone just to have it stop working after a month of moderate use.It's a shame, because for the price, it's a snappy little phone. I liked their UI, and it was fairly close to stock Android. Way better than anything with Touchwiz shoved on it, that's for sure. The camera wasn't that great, but I was willing to live with that. I may grab another one just because I liked the UI so much, but I am going to be very weary and much more proactive about keeping the proper warranty info.Maybe it would just be worth getting a Moto G instead.\n",

      "Pros-Smooth Performance-All Day Battery Life-Excellent Build Quality-Good Quality Screen-NFC (Android Pay Compatible)-Decent Camera-MicroSD ExpansionCons-Awkward Button Placement-Squeaky Vibrating Motor-Updates not guaranteed-No Gorilla GlassShould you buy: YESActual Value: $220I loved my Moto G. It made me always question why people spend over $600 on phones when a $200 could work just as well. With the new Moto G, I was willing to buy it right on the spot. But what turned me off was the nearly 3 weeks I’d have to wait for one to be delivered. So I started my search for the next best phone under $200, which lead me to this phone. I’ve had some experience with Alcatel phones, so I didn’t have much expectations with this phone. That being said, I’ve had a couple of days with it and I can say with absolute confidence that I love it.-Design-This is one light phone. I’m starting with that because you have no idea how light it is until you hold it in your hand. I actually thought for a moment that the battery wasn’t inside it yet. But it is pleasant to hold in the hand. The design is all plastic, so don’t expect anything premium on this phone like metal. But it is solidly built, rivaling even the Galaxy S5 in build quality. Speaking of which, this phone is lighter and slimmer than the S5. If the phone were sold for more money, I’d still be satisfied. It’s not just good build quality for the price. It’s excellent build quality. Period. The chrome accent is a nice touch and the speaker grills are slightly angled towards the phone, which add a bit of sparkle to an otherwise black phone. No soft touch plastic on this phone, but it does land on a middle ground where the plastic is nice to touch and is resistant to fingerprints. The design is completely symmetrical, which is important for a certain feature that is unique to it. I’d love it even more if it were available in a different color such as white, but that is personal preference. Overall, I can’t find much to complain; especially for the low $180 price.-Performance-If you have seen the Moto G’s specs, you’re pretty much getting the same hardware. It uses a Snapdragon 410, 720p display, microSD expansion, Android Lollipop, and even the same camera module (Sony IMX 214). However, there are a few key difference that make this a better phone than the Moto G. For instance, this phone has 1.5 GB of RAM (Moto G=1GB), actual front facing stereo speakers, a 4.7” compared to the 5”, NFC, and 16GB of storage(Moto G=1GB). In benchmarks, I have gotten similar results to the Moto G in both CPU and graphic performance. But benchmarks are only one side of the performance experience. The other is daily user experience. Based on the couple of days with it and after installing many apps, I can tell you that this phone is snappy. It’s not as fast as the current flagship lineup, but it never lags or clips the graphics. Apps open relatively quickly and the animations are smooth, as well as the transitions from one app to another. In my testing of multitasking ability, it opened Chrome, Angry Birds, Pokemon Puzzle, and YouTube with no lag and each app open where I left them off. Opening more will force the phone to suspend one of those apps to save RAM, but 4 apps at once without closing is pretty good for the cost. Games also perform good, as long as you have reasonable expectations. 2D games such as Angry Birds, Pokemon Puzzle, and Clash of Clans run smoothly and without an issue. Other games like Asphalt 8 and Real Racing 3 will run smooth, but not at the highest quality setting. But that’s to be expected from a midrange phone. Signal quality is good. I was able to get 62 Mbps download speed and 8 Mbps upload on T-Mobile’s 4G LTE around Pasadena, CA. Thanks to band 12 support, cell signal in buildings is good with the signal almost never going under 3 bars. The speakers are also amazingly good and loud, coming close to matching HTC’s Boomsound phone speakers thanks to the help from JBL. Overall, it performs close to flagship specs, albeit a bit slower. Most people should be happy with this phone.-Display-The phone itself has a beautiful HD display with a 312 PPI (note that the iPhone 6 has a 324 PPI) and it is advertise as being calibrated by Technicolor. While they aren’t at the S6’s quality display, it does come close. The display has a nice color calibration, with vivid colors and nice blacks and whites. It is also bright enough for using even in direct sunlight and the good contrast means you can clearly see what you are doing. It isn’t perfect since there are a couple of issues. The colors do have a VERY slight cool tone, meaning that the whites do have a TINY bit of blue to them. Another small issue is that there is a slight amount of light bleed on one side of the displace. But it isn’t noticeable in daily use and it is good for the price of the phone. One crucial one is the fact that they aren’t using Gorilla glass on this display, opting for the more discreet Dragontrail Glass. Since this is going to be my daily driver, I didn’t want to test the toughness (if Alcatel provides me a unit, I’d gladly test it) but I’ve looked into it and it trades scratch resistance for toughness. It might be easier to scratch it, but it is more resistant to shock. Only time will tell and I will update this review as time moves on.-Camera-The camera is a back-facing 13 MP camera and a front, wide angle 5 MP camera. The rear camera uses a Sony Exmor IMX 214, which is the same unit found in the new Moto G and the more expensive Nexus 6. The results are mixed though. On one side, outdoor pictures are good. Whenever there is good lighting such as outside or a well lit room, the pictures do come out high quality with colors mostly accurate and the camera absorbing a lot of details. However, during the night, the picture quality takes a hit, with the camera struggling to get any details from the lack of light. It will get some details if they is ANY type of light, but not much. The lack of OIS also contributes to this issue, but there is no phone with OIS at this price range at the moment. The flash is okay, but since it isn’t a dual tone unit, the light tends to overflow and photos tend to lose their details. Videos are also a similar story, with good lighting providing good results and the opposite being true. There is EIS, but the effect isn’t that noticeable and it doesn’t really help with the quality. This isn’t a camera you’re going to use for important, memorable moments. But for things that most people use, like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, it works great. This is especially true for the front facing camera, with the selfie cam grabbing a lot of details, provided there is good amount of light.-Software-This is basically running a close to stock version of Android Lollipop. It is running version 5.0.2 with a Stagefright patch already added to protect the phone from foreign attacks. There are a few changes to the software. For instance, the icons look like similar to the iPhone, which can be both a good and bad thing, depending on whether you love or hate that style. Other than that, everything works just like stock Android. Except for one feature that I’m surprised isn’t universal to all phones. That is the fact that this phone is reversible. It doesn’t sound as exciting as fingerprint sensor, but it is a rather practical and underrated feature. I’ve answered the phone to test the sound quality and it wasn’t until after I hung up that I realized the phone was upside down. It sounds equally good on either orientation and it is brilliant. Of course, if you don’t like this (for some reason) there is always the option to turn it off. Overall, the light touch that Alcatel added onto Android hasn’t hurt it much and any problems can be easily fixed.-Conclusion-I wasn’t expecting to get a high quality phone, especially after my experience with an old model that I can’t even remember the name. But Alcatel did deliver a high quality experience and an astonishing device. It does have some compromises, but Alcatel chose them wisely and the overall result is great. There is a couple of phones that compete in this range, but the biggest one is the Moto G. Is this better? Yes and no. For power users, I would still recommend the high end Moto G because of the extra RAM or even a OnePlus One, which is on sale now for $299. But if it must be under $200, like for college students like me, this beats the $179 low end Moto G due to the higher quality speakers, display, NFC, and the slightly more RAM. This phone helps to answer the question: Do people really need to spend over $800 on a phone to get a high quality experience? The answer for most people is no. They don’t. There is a market for people who need to have the latest and greatest with all the new extras like fingerprint sensor and DSLR-like quality cameras. But for the rest of us, there are phone that does what we ask from it and reasonably well not just for the price, but just overall. If you are on the fence and frustrated from searching like I was, let me help you. Go for this phone and you won’t be disappointed.\n",

      "As of late I've been on something of a \"phone journey\". I first purchased an Idol 3 5.5\", but the phone was just too darn big to be practical (at least for me). I returned it, and then picked up the new Moto G 2015 (which I also did a review on). It was an excellent phone, but in the end I discovered it was missing some key features that I really needed in a daily driver device.First, the Moto G was missing a notification LED. Sure, some of you may think \"who cares, it has Moto display\", but there are times where this just isn't optimal. When the phone was on my desk and I happened to miss a notification (which normally flashed 3 times, but sometimes just once, probably bugged), to find out I even had one I had to either 1.) reach across the desk and wave my hand over the device, 2.) pick it up which would activate the screen (which didn't always work, either), or 3.) physically hit the power button. A notification LED eliminates the need for all of that fuss. That light is going to blink until I check/clear my notifications, for me this is PERFECT!Moto G is also missing a gyroscope. Not overly important to me (most of the time), but this is useful for things such as 360 degree YouTube videos, certain games, etc. Another win for Alcatel!Moto G doesn't include a magnetometer. Wanna use a compass app on the Moto G? Too bad, so sad. Alcatel 3 - Motorola 0.No NFC on the Moto G. Wanna pay using Android Pay in the future? Well, you can't do that with the Moto G! Idol 3 strikes again!Only 8GB internal storage on the similarly priced Moto G. What's that? You want 16GB for 179.99? Don't worry, Alcatel has you covered.Moto G only offers 1GB RAM on the 179.99 model. While 1GB is \"sufficient\" with careful usage, I'll gladly take 1.5GB for the same price, thanks Idol 3!The screen. While their resolutions are the same (1280 x 720), the Idol 3 4.7\" sports a 312 PPI pixel density, while the Moto G only comes in at 294. More pixels? More clarity? Yup! I'll take it!Dual front facing speakers with JBL sound? They sound absolutely amazing. The Moto G at least had the decency to have its only speaker on the front, but there is zero contest here. These speakers sound just as good as the ones from the 5.5\" Idol 3!While there are more positives, I just wanted to lay out the comparisons between the Idol 3 4.7\" and the Moto G 2015 1GB model, as these are the most often compared devices. In my honest opinion, there is zero contest between the two and I feel that Alcatel did an amazing job on this device. At first I was a bit leery of the 1.2Ghz Quad Core CPU, but I've had zero issues with lollipop and everything is buttery smooth! I fully recommend this to anyone, as it is well worth the price of admission!\n",

      "It's a great smartphone at a super affordable price! I was looking for a reliable budget smartphone to purchase for my parents, who were learning to use smartphones for the first time. So something basic with a long battery life was ideal. After looking intensively at budget smartphones, I narrowed my choices down to the Alcatel OneTouch or the Moto G (3rd Gen). I was ultimately swayed by the Alcatel because they had the 4.7\" screen size option and I am glad it worked out well.It was very easy to learn and use, great camera, decent battery life, and my mom loves it. The only comment I have to add, is the limited options for changing the language. There were a couple of options, but Chinese was not one of them. If language settings are a top concern for purchasing this phone, I would suggest you to find out what options you would need. (I know the Moto G offers a couple more languages, including Chinese.) Otherwise, I have no other complaints. I would even consider getting this phone for myself!\n",

It looks great, but most people put their phone in some dopey protector case, so what is the big deal with the chrome and glimmery looks except on the commercials and in the show room. But this phone looks high class anyway. I hate to cover it up in a case. All operations are a \"GO\". One neg., and I was aware of this from Android phone reviewers - the camera. It takes great photos EXCEPT for back lit shots, then the photos turn out like you took the photo in a light fog. I got this phone, because I need a PHONE' so the camera I can give or take.

I currently use straight talk so all I had to do was literally insert my Sim and configure the Internet apn settings and within 5 minutes, the phone works, data works, texting and mms works amazing. Only complaint is when I'm on the phone with someone, I can't really hear then that well. But if your like me and all you do is text or surf the Web, this phone is perfect for you.

      "So far so good. Needed a stopgap for my old Nexus 5 since the battery has died by noon everyday in recent weeks. I've tried a few of the 5.5\" mid-range phones that have been released recently and none of them seem to be right for me. I just can't seem to get used to using a larger phone. Started using this phone 2 days ago and it's been great so far.No stuttering at all, and has kept the same pace as my Nexus did, yet the battery has lasted albeit with weekend usage. The standby on this phone is Apple-esqe, I left it off the charger overnight and lost 2% of battery life. I'll get a chance to see what normal business use will get me today.The speakers on this phone are some of the best I've ever heard on a smart phone. Loud and clear. I don't normally use my phone speaker as I will connect to a bluetooth speaker in the house, but it's not really needed any longer.Phone feels very solid in the hand for a phone that is entirely plastic, but it is VERY light.For $175 this phone is a bargain so far.*Edit* Not sure if its just a bad handset or an issue with this phone but when connected to a call via Bluetooth I hear a loud clicking noise. Sounds a bit like a helicopter over the call. Tried it in my car and with 2 sets of Bluetooth headphones, all three have the same sound. It's a shame was loving this phone.\n",

      "UPDATE November 2016 -I have downgraded my rating of this phone due to a system update patch dated November 1, 2016. This update kills the functionality of the 'tap to wake' feature that lets you tap on the screen to wake it up. This is a WONDERFUL feature that I loved on this phone. But this feature was largely killed with the November 2016 update. It now only works MAYBE 5% of the time I tap the screen to wake it. This is a REALLY obnoxious killing of a great feature. If Alcatel eliminates great features like this after purchase it eliminates my trust in the company and I would not buy an Alcatel product in the future because of this. I don't particularly care if this was intentional or is just a bug. They sent an update patch that changed something I don't want changed. That's a screw up and I'm not happy.░░░░░GOOD PHONE / OKAY CAMERA░░░░░I got this for my wife to replace the Galaxy S6 we bought a few months ago. Turns out that phone was just too darn big. The Idol 3 4.7\" version ends up being perfectly sized for a normal person’s hand.This is a nice phone in general. It's a great phone when you factor in the price and overall value. With the hardware being so capable for such a reasonable price this phone could be a game changer for the Smartphone industry, forcing the major players to bring pricing down. I said the same thing about the 5.5\" version of the Idol 3 a few months ago and with the popularity that device and the ASUS ZenFone 2 are enjoying in this price range, I am convinced you'll see more reasonably priced phones from the major market players in the next 2 years.░░░░░THE GOOD░░░░░❖ The sound - The front facing JBL speakers make this a solid rival to the HTC One M9. If you use your phone for multi media like watching videos or listening to music without headphones this is a solid sound system for you. The sound is vibrant and most importantly it's loud. And it's clear sound. It doesn't sound like a tiny cell phone speaker. It sounds like a real speaker. The HTC One product line made the front facing speakers it's calling card and no one really challenged the HTC design until now. The Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 stands toe to toe with the HTC One sound and doesn't flinch.❖ It physically looks like a nice phone, not a cheap off brand.❖ It's not the most powerful processor in a Smartphone, and it's a little lower powered than the 5.5\" variant but it's plenty good enough to drive the Idol 3 for normal daily use. I didn't find it to be laggy at all doing normal stuff. Through all of the set up process and a couple hours of use there was no lag.❖ It has expandable storage! Thank you for keeping this feature in a smart phone. I hate the cloud. I want to have my files on my device. The Idol 3 starts at 16GB on board (not all usable as the system takes up some of that) but it's expandable up to 128GB via the tried and true SD card method. So you can expand the storage significantly for $20-$50. Meanwhile some of the higher end Smartphones will charge you more than the entire purchase price of the Idol 3 to increase from a 32GB base model to a 128GB model.❖ The HD 4.7\" display is VERY nice. The colors are vibrant. They may be slightly more vibrant than true life colors, but it works. Photos look richer, even if you don't get true life coloring. All the rendered graphics look fantastic due to the rich color depth. (Meaning stuff like your icons and games and the UI interface, etc etc). The resolution is a little lower than the 5.5\" version, but the screen is also smaller so it's not very noticeable. This phone sas the same resolution as the 30 inch HDTV in my bedroom.❖ The back is flat! I like to lay my phone down on a desk or table next to me and be able to use it for things like checking a sports score or just checking off a notification or something. With a rounded back on the phone it will wobble and be annoying. The Idol 3 has a flat back so it lays flat on the table and doesn't wobble when you touch it. This is such a simple thing but it's HUGE for me.❖ It’s SUPER thin. (See my picture with comparison next to my finger) It’s thinner than my Galaxy S4, with just a slightly smaller screen. (Its’ significantly smaller than screen on the Galaxy S6 we sold) And it’s very light weight.❖ The camera was an initial area of concern for me. Everything looked over exposed and blurry. This was largely fixed with an alternate camera app (more on that later). It's still not the greatest camera in the world, but I have to factor in the price tag on the phone. For $180 it's a good enough camera. In high light (outdoors in day time) it's actually pretty decent. In low light (anytime you need the flash) it's not so hot.░░░░░THE BAD░░░░░❖ The stock camera app is complete garbage in all aspects. You can improve the photo quality a little by adjusting the manual settings, but you lose the settings as soon as you restart the app. It doesn't save them. On the stock settings everything is massively overexposed with the light balance making everything look blue. This almost caused me to return the phone, making me think the camera itself was bad. Plan on using an alternate camera app. I switched to Camera MX for photos. (Available on Amazon, but newer versions on Google Play) Camera MX has a conflict with video on this phone though and simply doesn't work. The stock camera app works okay for video.❖ The battery is not replaceable. They do wear out after a while and I like to keep phones for years and repurpose them for other things after their service life as a phone expires. (As controllers for things, MP3 jukeboxes, etc) I like being able to go on Amazon, spend $20 on a replacement battery and quickly switch it out. Additionally, even if you don't keep your phones that long, batteries fail sometimes. So no replaceable battery is a problem for me. This might not be an issue for you. If not, great! But be aware of the issue before making purchase decisions. I sucked it up on this one because it's my wife's phone and she didn't care. But I don't love this industry trend.░░░░░THE BOTTOM LINE░░░░░❖ It EASILY outperforms it's $180 purchase price. It's not the greatest Smartphone of all time, but you cannot beat this phone for $180. I said the same thing about the 5.5\" version's $250 price. The 4.7\" isn't as good of a phone overall as the 5.5\" which has more physical room in the housing to cram in better specs, but for $180 the 4.7\" version is a great value, even with the camera not being an industry leader.❖ Ultimately you have to decide what features are important to you. If you never use the camera or don't use it for anything you want to keep, like maybe you just take pictures of your parking space so you remember where you parked, it's a great smartphone. I love the form factor of it. It's thinness. It's weight. It's display. It's all very nice.❖ Use an alternate camera app that gives you more control over the exposure. An alternate camera app changed my decision to return this phone. I had this as a 4 star review until I had better luck with different apps. I also compared the quality of the photos to the price tag of the phone and realized that it's a great value. You can get a better camera on a phone, but it will cost more to do it. For $180 you really can't go wrong.\n",

Speakers are good but my Bluetooth is horrible I put the phone in my pocket and simply turn around and my Bluetooth speaker will cut out don't have that problem with other phones anyone else have this problem? Did drop the phone once before I activated it though. Hitting the power and volume down at the same time will do a screenshot which seems almost unavoidable and it happens all the time and is really getting on my nerves hell my home screen freaked out or so I thought until I realized I was looking at a s***load of screenshots can't find an option the disable this feature yet. The cameras focus is horrible compared to my old Moto E and my Samsung Avant. Something about unlocking the screen and about the way the notifications work has really been annoying.

Slim, and easily held in one hand.Good performance (connectivity, tasks, etc....)Great stereo sound with the built in speakers. As a music listening device it's terrific.The bad:Unfortunately as a phone it's really not great.Could only faintly hear the other person in my apartment (even with the volume maxed), and on a noisy NYC street it was nearly impossible.The battery life is terrible. I suspect I might've gotten a dud, because with very light use (listening to music and checking emails a couple of times), the phone barely lasted a little more than half a day.Overall, the low volume and bad battery life made me return it quickly.

      "Iv'e had the phone for around a week now and just love it. From the form factor to the amazing front firing speakers to the intuitive stock android lollipop interface. I am using it on cricket wireless and everything just worked right away once i popped my sim card in. Wifi and LTE reception are on par or possibly superior to the LG G2 i replaced. Battery life on standby isnt quite as good as my G2, but while actually using the phone (watching videos especially) it mops the floor of the G2 in terms on on screen time. This is due to the lower res (but still very nice) screen and lower power snapdragon 410 CPU. Dont let the lower power fool you, ive yet to run into any scenario the phone hasnt performed just as well as my G2, which on paper is twice as fast. Just a heads up to buyers of the 5.5\" model (too big for my tastes, but seems to be the preferred size nowadays) is that it is coming to cricket wireless nov 6th for 149.00 bucks, 100 bucks off retail. Mind you it wont be unlocked, this would just be for people using cricket, and as a cricket customer i have only good things to say about them (they use ATT towers, they are the best MNVO by miles).The only con i can come up with on the phone is that it does not beep at you when fully charged, but the LED light goes off after its been at 100% for a couple minutes. I remedied this with an app called Gsam for the app store, now my phone beeps when it hits 100% :)In my opinion this blows away the competition (looking at you moto g) for the money, 16gb storage and 1.5gb memory really put it head and shoulders above other phones in this price range. Not to mention the better screen, absurdly loud speakers and overall dainty form factor (for a phone in 2015).Trust me, you will not regret this purchase, especially if you are looking for a phone under the \"norm\" 5\"+ form factor.\n",

      "Great product! I'm loving the smaller phone. It's a breath of fresh air from all these phablets and near phablets. I guess I'm in a minority for wanting a smaller phone. Battery life is great and performance is really good. I can't see any lags navigating through menus. I don't play games on my phone so I'm not sure how good the graphics processor. It has outstanding standby time. The screen is great even under sun light. The phone is very light and it produces incredible sound from its dual stereo front facing speakers. The screen is very crisp despite not being 1080P (not a knock, anything below 5\" screen doesn't need a 1080P screen). I've had the 5.5\" version but found it a bit too big for my taste. This phone is perfect, it's even a tad bit smaller than an iPhone 6/6S. 16GB is fine paired up with my 64GB Sandisk memory card. I didn't even think about the Moto G 2015 because with 16GB it's already close to the Idol 3 5.5\" ~$250 price. I'm not so worried about updates. As long as there are security patches and the apps work, then it's fine.\n",

      "Update 3/07/16:I have moved my rating from a 4 to 5.The TracFone AT&T 4G LTE sim works great at Bodega Bay. So we have good connections in what has been a blackout area for years.I upgraded my text system to the MySms premium for better texting and easier texting pictures to family and friends.I added Camera MX for better picture taking and ease of transmitting pictures with the MySms as noted above. The system works seamlessly with Amazon Prime Photos. Take a picture. In a short time it is on Amazon Prime, and I can text the photos to our friends and family in seconds. I have just scratched the surface with the capabilities of Camera MX, and it surpasses any phone camera or camera I have had in over a decade.The battery continues to be amazing and also eliminates the drain on my Android tablet / Chromebook with the MySyms connection.So this great phone fits in my pockets is powerful and does anything I need or want with the phone, internet connection and camera +4G LTE!The cost of this is about $200.The first part of the below is for Tracfone customers/users. If you don’t use Tracfone, go below the dotted line for my review.For a week, my new Alcatel Idol 3, 4.7 didn’t work with my transferred Tracfone minutes and years of use. The Tracfone site showed that my BYOP transfer had worked with my new BYOP sim card, and all of my minutes, data and time left were transferred. The phone didn’t work to make/receive calls or texts.Alcatel was of no help. A friend suggested that I email Tracfone to set up a phone call with them. I did and got online, with someone as per the email from them. He claimed they didn’t have any of my data. Including tracfone phone # and id #’s. Fortunately, I had made a hard copy of what I had re time and years on my old smartphone and what Tracfone showed with my new Sim cardI told him that I needed to speak with someone, who could help me. Then on hold for 15 minutes, when a nice woman answered and again wanted all the data I had emailed and told the other phone person. After, I re told her the specific data, reading from my hard copy made the day the BYOP was supposedly activated. Then, she said I didn’t have anytime left on my contract, and I need to buy more time. I reminded her of the hard data showing over 2000 minutes and time of agreement for years to come. That was a 30 minute + call process.She said that she had to transfer me to another supervisor. She did, and the new person started asking for my data given twice that call. I said that I had sent all of that in via email, and I had given that data twice on the same phone call. She found my contract and said my phone wasn’t 4.7 working because my time/minutes/data hadn’t been transferred. She did her thing on her end and my phone fired up and I dialed in the code to activate it.It now works with well over one hour on the phone going over same stuff 3 times with Tracfone on line people------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Evaluation of this phone is now 5 stars.Before, I got my Tracfone problem corrected, I had used my new phone via wifi to transfer the contacts, pictures and apps from my old android LG phone. Most of this went well. The transfer of stuff from a nearby or close Android (Acer tablet, old Android phone and my Acer Chromebook 15, which I’m using for this report), didn’t work.The wifi reception is good but not as strong as my wife’s Alcatel One Touch Android. Where I use it at home, the wifi reception is strong and very fast.The 4.7” screen fits in my shirt pockets even after the bottom half of the add on hard case was added.The screen size is adequate for what I want to do away from home, to make/receive phone calls and text/receive and check texts and emails. I will use my Acer 8 tablet or my Chromebook for more involved keyboard/screen work at home.The battery, so far is adequate so far for my uses. Last night it was @ ¾ charge, and I didn’t charge it. This morning it was still @ ¾ charged and again at 2 pm this afternoon. When, I picked it up again and turned it on it was still at 3/4.Bloatware is at a minimum.It accepted my 64 gig card with no fuss.The Android 5.0 seems to be smoother and less drag than our previous 4.?.It works smoothly with MY SMS which I have on my tablet and Chromebook.Also, when you receive a phone call, you don’t push or make contact directly with the phone Icon. You have slide that Icon to the right to answer. I have had cell phones since the 1990’s, and that is different.Since the phone is now working with Tracfone, I have to push the app buttons on the screen harder than before.The glass add on screen I bought is too big. The standard screen gets very messy very quickly with minimal useage. I will try to find an aftermarket glass that fits.The combo hard case and belt case (extra buy) is a mixed picture. The hard case fits fairly well;however if you attach that to the other half of the hard case, you can’t really get the camera out to make phone calls, receive them or to take a picture. You have to remove the part that covers the phone and the back part of the case. I missed two phone calls from my wife due to this time delay to get to the front of the phone. Also, I didn’t get a picture of some on the move wildlife in our area due to this problemIf you use Tracfone BYOP, and your phone doesn’t work. Don’t waste your time contacting Alcatel. Send Tracfone an email with your data and tell them your phone isn’t working. Tracfone will send you an email with a phone# and a numeric code to use. When you, make that call, sit in a comfortable chair and have a hardline phone available, all of your data available, a bottle of water, a lot of patience, and your well charged Alcatel Idol 3. I used my Acer Chromebook to help with the data, the “lost” data and other stuff they needed.In this short time, I think that Alcatel and Tracfone have a good winning combo. If you use Tracfone’s BYOP, and you are an established customer wanting to transfer your minutes and time, be sure to make hard copies of your minutes and data. You will probably need that data.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update re the battery. It is an excellent battery with heavy use. It is the best cell phone battery, we have ever owned re standby. It holds the charge in standby versus our other androids phones and tablets using the battery charge overnight or just standing unplugged.Re wifi connections. It quickly recognizes our home wifi and connects and other hot spots seamlessly. Its wifi range in our house isn't as good as my wife's Alcatel One Touch Popup, which is incredible re its wifi range. However, since I never use these phones in our bedroom and a few other weak wifi areas, that is not an issue. The auto switch from wifi to Tracfone 4G LTE like going from our family room to our back yard is auto and seamless. So far the Tracfone/AT&T 4G LTE in our area is very strong and reliable. Hopeoufully, we can try the AT&T 4G LTE in/on our coastal areas where our Verizon/Trackfone coverage is zero.The Android 5.? seems to be more reliable and easier to do simple things with versus the Android 4.?'s.\n",

After 3 months with this phone, I am counting it as a loss and going back to Motorola. It takes 3x longer to do anything you need to do on this phone. The keyboard is not responsive and poorly calibrated, the speakers aren't great, and there are no compatible apps that compare to Motorola assist. Making phone calls takes about three extra steps, and I rarely am able to make or receive calls due to poor reception. I would blame that on the phone service company, but my boyfriend and I are on a family plan and he gets reception when I don't. The text message app is horrible, I downloaded a new one to make it usuable. This phone would be a good starter phone for a teenager, but that's about it.

      "Have only owned it for about a week. Battery saver is excellent for me but if you're walking around with the phone in your pocket, it will detect motion and may not sleep as you might expect. Mine sits on a table much of the day and so it sleeps soundly. :-) Speakers are nice JBL but bass response is still lacking which is inherent in the extremely thin design of this phone. You may need to install an equalizer to reduce mid and high frequencies for a richer sound. I would have given 5 stars except that there is a small \"sweet spot\" when listening on a phone call. If the phone is not placed just so on the ear, the volume is reduced significantly. I think it just takes some practice. The dual speakers and dual microphones work beautifully for quickly answering phone upside down if necessary. FM radio will not run unless earphones are plugged in as they act as an antenna. Display is perfect for me. Some built in wallpapers look pixelated but they're probably just crappy samples. As you'll see with Android 5, you cannot have a different wallpaper on your lock screen. So much for using it as a quick flashlight like I did with my old phone.Android 5 does come with a flashlight hidden in the SECOND pull-down notification menu with the Bluetooth and WiFi buttons. The flashlight is not an \"app\". Note: WiFi does NOT turn on using the \"WiFi Display\" app. You must use either the settings menu or the second pull down menu to do that. This phone has an auto-dimming screen which also automatically brightens to max when in sunlight. VERY nice feature but you may find that a nearby light source in a dark room could fool the sensor and make it dimmer than you want it. Just adjust the angle of the screen so that the sensor detects the light and the screen will brighten accordingly. You can also turn this feature off.This is not a \"department store\" brand. They are sold at T-Mobile stores and I was told by a clerk that the Idol 3 is really nice and they don't have it to sell because they were sent a lesser version by corporate.Almost forgot to mention the most important thing; This phone is an upgrade from my 3 year old Samsung which was loading pages agonizingly slow. This Alcatel with Android 5 and LTE loads pages almost instantly! AND this phone is eligible for the Android 6 Marshmallow upgrade as soon as it is available. No luck yet trying to upgrade but I love it! Marshmallow will allow you to override permissions for each app. Other than that, not much change.If you sign up for an Amazon Signature card like I did, you can get an extra $50. off this phone. BEWARE: Amazon automatically changes your default payment method to the new card! If you don't want that, go to your settings and change it back to your old card. Also, the phone must be purchased with the Amazon card to get the discount. So remember to pay off the card right away if you don't want interest charged. You have 21 days grace period. I've had this card before. Keep an eye on your default payment before you check out because it was changed on me once before without my knowledge before making a purchase. One-click ordering is what caused it to happen to me as it does not give you an opportunity to see your default payment method.\n",

      "Bought this phone to replace my wife's phone which is several years old and needed replacing. The phone came boxed with the charger, cord, headphones and instructions. There were English instructions that were well written and easy to follow. It took us about 30 minutes to set up the phone for here and move everything thing over. It has working flawlessly since we got it and she is very pleased with it. It is not going to compete with some of very high end phones but it does have a quad core processor and plenty of speed for what she does. For the price, this is one of the nicest phones that I have seen\n",

I will be calling Alcatel Modnay not happy about being without a phone for 3 weeks as i hear on the net. I lliked this phone on every category, voice calls, text, camera good, fast etc but ignored that you can't replace the battery. I'll let you know what happens with manufacturer.

      "This is a very nice phone and I am almost 100% pleased with it, especially the battery life. It outshines my old iPhone 4s battery life by miles.First the cons: I do not like that the wake up/power button is directly opposite of the volume bar switch. The iPhone wake button is much better placed. I also do not like that you have to bring up settings and then ringtones and then scroll to None click on it and then click OK to turn off the ringer and use only vibrate, here again the iPhone has it beat hands down with the little switch on the side.Now the Pros: The screen is really nice and much easier to keep clean that the iPhone, the operating system has IPhone beat hands down, the speaker system is really much more that I expected from a device this small and, to top it off you can answer it from either end with the reversible microphone. The battery life is really great compared to my old iPhone4s. Over all this phone rates about a solid 95%.I am using it on Wal-Mart's family plan which is serviced by T-Mobile and the signal is not quite as good as Verizon was with my old iPhone but it the service is acceptable for what I use it for. I do feel tho it would be stronger on AT&T snd I may at some point switch to them but for now it is serving my purposes well.\n",

      "I've had ZTE AWE, LG G2, iPhone 5s, Idol 3 5.5\" and now Idol 3 4.7\".This phone is slim, light, and perfect size for the pocket and web browsing. The Idol 5.5\" was too large to keep comfortably in my pocket without breaking it.The screen has a yellower white, which I like better for reading. The screen of the Idol 5.5\" had a bright bluish white, which often hurt my eyes. Both screens are very reflective - remedied by a MATTE screen protector by Mr. Shield.The battery is 2000 mAh, which to my surprise is sufficient to stream Pandora on 4G the whole day. I always thought that I needed 3000 mAh for a whole day operation but the new version of Android is surprisingly battery efficient.The sound from the phone speakers is loud and clear with some depth, but definitely not with super bass or \"like from big speakers\", as some reviews are claiming. Strangely, the ringing and notifications are decreased in volume when headphones are plugged in - definitely a software bug that Alcatel has to straighten out.While the sound through the on-board speakers is good, JBL did an exceptionally poor job with the sound enhancement through headphones, for which I am removing one star. Most cheap earbuds (less than $20) that I tried with the Idol 3 sounded with weak bass. Turning on the JBL \"audio effects\" attempts to create surround sound by distancing/depressing the mid frequencies, corresponding to human voices. That results in decreased clarity and \"muddy\" sound. The included JBL earphones were the worst from the bunch I tried with no clear highs and a complete lack of bass. I would not pay even $5 for those. Only the earbuds that came with my iPhone 5s had crystal clarity and after I pumped the bass with the Bass Booster app, the sound became acceptable and listening to Pandora enjoyable.A pleasant surprise was the back (13 Mpx) f/2.0 aperture camera, which is the same in the 4.7\" and the 5.5\" models. Its Automatic mode takes good pics in good light. The Automatic is not smart enough in low light so I turn on the Manual mode, set timer to 5s to avoid camera shake, and ISO to about 800. With these manual settings, I was able to get sharp selfies (can see my skin pores) without much noise even in very dim light (indoors, early in the morning on a cloudy day). In comparison, the iPhone 5s automatic mode rarely produced sharp pics in dim light (like indoors during the day), while LG G2 got them but smeared all fine details like eyelashes and skin pores due to agressive noise reduction. The pics that I get with the Idol 3 come out with colors close to what my eyes see with slight saturation of reds. In comparison, LG G2 had a tendency to produce washed out (bluer) pics.In terms of everyday tasks, the 4.7\" Idol 3 is just as fast as the 5.5\" version, and is even faster in the animation when you close all open apps and they slide off the screen one by one. The 5.5\" version stutters in that ?! The 4.7\" Idol 3 has slower processor on specs but has to control fewer screen pixels or is better optimized. I rarely play games on phones so can't compare the two phones in that department. Both phones stutter when browsing the DESKTOP version of image-intensive web pages like Amazon but even my powerful desktop computer does that. It has more to do with downloading all the images and the site programming than with how fast the phone video processor is. The occasional slight stutter does not defray from pleasant web browsing.\n",

      "Unlocked phones were never this good before. As a phone it works great. The camera is good in daylight, not so good in dark settings, but for the price that's fair. The screen itself looks very good, way better than the run of the mill budget phones. The speakers are fantastic. Alcatel has a partnership with JBL and you get a very decent set of JBL earbuds included. The most obvious con to me is the speed, which is just OK. This is why I docked a star, although for the price this is as much as you can expect.This phone runs a close to pure version of android 5.02. When you first power on the phone, it prompts you to download a software update that takes care of the stagefright vulnerability.If you are on T-Mobile, this phone has band 12.Although the phone lets you uninstall some apps, one app that can't be uninstalled and can't be disabled is the music player. I like to use another music player app and I have to be careful that I don't turn the factory one on by mistake, or else I'll have 2 different songs playing at the same time.I've noticed that if I'm holding the phone upside down (ie, if I'm reading lying down) when I click the screen, it might not take. But if I'm just holding the phone in my hand with the screen facing up (which is the normal way) then it works every time.All in all, I have only minor nits to pick and I think this to be an all around solid phone. Even if you don't buy this phone, don't automatically buy a phone from a carrier....shop around and you can find more for your money.\n",

      "I gave it 3 stars instead of 2 because of the price. It has numerous smaller bugs (I assume in the firmware). The most recent and most annoying one is where at random times it starts playing music (seriously). Its not the music app, because I checked it, it wasn't playing anything, then I closed it and all other open apps and the music continued. It must have been streaming since I didn't have that music, yet it was a completely different genre from the last playlist I streamed. Often when I unlock my phone and start doing stuff the music stops, but not always.Still an OK phone if you have no money. I'm hoping this is an isolated incident and will try to replace my phone.\n",

      "Received firmware updates since I bought it, making it much MUCH better than when it first arrived, IMO. But the weird thing is sometimes I pull it out of my pocket and it's jus a black screen. No matter how many times I hit the power button it won't wake up or turn on - I have to hold the power button for 10 seconds to reset it. This has happened through multiple firmware versions. Also, the auto-brightness has a tendency to stay bright and melt my eyes at night.The screen quality is nice, but over time I'm starting to be able to see something behind the screen - not sure if they're individual LEDs or if they're related to the digitizer / touch sensor or what, they look like small rings (although I will admit this phone has already taken a beating and I don't protect it with a case since it was an inexpensive device).Overall, though, the speed and responsiveness are nice. It's not the best device I've ever owned, but for the price I paid, I'm not too unhappy The speakers are fairly impressive, and they can get nice and loud on their own. In the end, it's VERY light and thin and that is impressive, but there are probably more impressive phones available for less money if you want something that was a flagship a few years ago. The downside to those is, you might not end up with Marshmallow, like this phone has been upgraded to.6.0.1. If you leave it at the stock 5.x that it came with, you're probably going to be very disappointed in this phone - I know I wasn't impressed with it at all until the firmware update arrived.\n",

      "We bought two of these phones (at full price, so this is an actual customer review, not one that may be biased by having received it for free or at a discount) a few months ago and still really love them. We spent quite a bit of time researching all of the options available both above and below this price range, and this phone looked to be a great value, and it really is. We are very pleased with our purchase. We use it with T-Mobile on one of their pre-paid plans and have had a very good experience with the phone and T-Mobile. We are also going to be traveling outside the country, and this phone comes unlocked and supports all of the bands that we need.Pros: The screen looks great, and is very bright and crisp. The camera takes very nice pictures and video. The phone fits nicely in the hand and looks and feels like a much more expensive phone. The build quality is excellent. We charge them after a couple days of normal use, so the battery seems to last a respectable amount of time. The sound, as other reviewers have mentioned, is just excellent. This thing can really put out some sound, and gone are the days of not being able to hear your phone ring! Playing music on it sounds great, and is stereo (one speaker at each end of the phone). The phone is reversible, with a microphone and speaker at each end, so it doesn't matter which way its facing when you pick it up to answer it, the phone will just take care of it based on the orientation using the gyro sensor. This isn't really a must have feature, but it is kind of nice. It plays videos (such as YouTube) very well, and it feels very smooth and responsive in every app we've tried. The value for the money is great, and we would still be very happy with it if we paid more.Cons:Wish it supported dual sim cards instead of just one, but you get a microSD card spot instead, so not too bad and most people probably only need one sim card slot anyway.Wish the volume could be adjusted in smaller increments, but this isn't the phone's fault, it's an android thing and not a deal breaker at all.In closing, we are very pleased with our purchase of two of these phones and would quickly and happily buy them again. If you are looking for a great unlocked GSM phone and don't want to pay an arm and a leg, then give this one a try. We highly recommend it!\n",

      "This seems to be a great little phone.When I saw it would cost $700 to get a new Samsung to replace my old S3, I shopped around. I bought the Alcatel Idol 3 (4.7\") from Amazon and after a week am pretty much thrilled at how well it works.The setup had some bumps for me because my cloud files were not up to date. My advice here is to update your contacts, files (including downloads), and pictures before cluttering the new phone with junk So don't log in to your Google acount (yes, even just for email) until stuff is updated and synch'ed up on the old phone.Also, perhaps because the Alcatel phone is \"unlocked\" and is not a service provider's proprietary device, it does not wake up in your hand knowing how to handle internet data. When you enter an in-range WiFi password, the Internet will work fine. To get it to work when you do NOT have WiFi, you will need to setup the mobile networks. This might be as easy as selecting your; provider in settings:(wireless networks - more - mobile networks - access point names - and then either select yourprovider.) You might need to enter the info manually if your provider is not listed. I found listings online by searching for \"AT&T Alcatel APN settings\" but didn't need it because my carrier is AT&T and there was a preconfigured choice as I described earlier.The \"unlocked\" feature is great because it means the phone works with SIM chips from any provider. So if I switch from AT&T to Verizon, Sprint, or any other service provider, this phone will work instantly as soon as I insert the chip. Also, if I travel to a foreign country -- in addition to being able to function on multiple networks --, I will be able to buy a chip for any country and put it into my own phone. If you have travelled, you know what I am talking about. Using your own phone is wonderful in foreign countries.NOTE: My phone accepted a memory chip in addition to the SIM; I see you CAN get a dual SIM option; which I do not understand. The little chip carrier can removed by pushing a paper clip into the tiny hole on the left side of the phone. The little tray slides all the way out. The chips do not fit snugly, but must be sort of balanced or set carefully and then inserted gently. I was actually surprised when it worked because the whole process seemed to require more faith than skill. The phone is so small and compact, it is easy to forgive this space saving compromise.I haven't compared the camera, but it seems fine. I got accustomed to popping the back off my Samsung and just dropping in a newly charged battery, but the Alcatel is sealed. I guess if the battery dies I will need to send it in for service or just replace the whole thing.In general, I think there are enough good reasons to give this phone a try and it is a low risk. Alcatel also makes a 5.5\" phone, so if you want a bigger unit, it's an option.I know this sounds almost evangelical, but I do pay attention to details. Seems like a winner to me.\n",

This is coming from someone who was using one of the largest phablets around in the Sony Xperia Z Ultra.It offers a nice compact clean design asthetic, great dual front facing speakers and a lil touch of customization (mainly icons and a few apps) on top of stock Android 5.0.2 as of writing this review.The processing package had me concerned at first but once you actually use the device and tailor it your liking, you realize how snappy and responsive it really is. My only complaint is that Alcatel didn't go all out and create enough accessories for this phone, it's kinda difficult to find a decent case for it but I enjoy the design language so much that I'm willing to just go 'naked' with this one.In conclusion, I'm very happy with my purchase and may consider buying the 5.5 inch sibling down the road.\n",

If you not a power user this phone is great , it does everything you want it too and I've averaged about 5.5 hours of SOT on wifi. So buy with confidence.\n",

      "Excellent budget android phone. I have been unhappy with my previous phone for some time. I felt like finding the right phone at a decent price was impossible. I wanted 4g LTE, unlocked gsm, 16gb internal with an expandable storage SD slot, and it needed to be 4.7\" or less to comfortably fit in my hands and my wallet. I found a few compact phones that would work, but they would cost upwords of $200 used. This phone fit the criteria. I know decreasing its size downgraded some of the specs from the 5.5\" version, but I am a simple smartphone user and don't need a top of the line phone. This phone is lighter and has better specs than my old phone, so I am happy!\n",

      "[EDIT]I've completely altered my original review, as my unit no longer has many of the problems I originally encountered, and a call-drop problem was actually being caused by the way the phone was handling the Skype app. I still have the light-bleed issue, which is the only reason I'm dropping a star. Otherwise, it's been a pretty good phone. One other potential issue is that the phone doesn't really integrate very well with expandable memory, but this is hardly an Android issue exclusive to the OneTouch.\n",

      "I am very happy that I purchased this phone. I switched from a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 because it was outdated and just too big! I was sick of it. So I went out to T-Mobile to upgrade to a new phone but I couldn't find one that was significantly smaller than the Note 2 (5.7\" screen). They just do not make normal sized phones anymore. That is where the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 4.7\" comes into play. It is the PERFECT SIZE. The only thing big about this phone is the name! Good specs for somebody who just needs a phone for normal use. Yes, it is not the fastest phone out there but for the money, you CAN'T beat it! To be honest, it is very snappy to me and the screen quality is great. Not to mention, the 13MP camera is extremely fast and takes good quality pics.I highly recommend this phone!Also note, in my experience, the Amazon free shipping was extremely slow! I would upgrade to the next available shipping method if you want your phone in less than a week.\n",

      "I purchased the 4.7 version after having the 5.5 for 2wks. I wanted to see if the smaller version would be the larger version in smaller packaging. I was a bit disappointed because battery life is my most important feature in any device. The screen was also not as stunning as the larger. For the price it's a decent phone but I was not purely impressed. I still have the 5.5 version and have very little negative remarks. It's definitely large which is the only thing I don't like. I wouldn't recommend the 4.7 version over other budget phones.\n",

      "My day to day phone is a Samsung Note 4, so I wanted a smaller phone for times when the Samsung is just too large. I've only had the Idol for a day, but for most people who don't do serious gaming on a cell, it's a great bargain. It's very light, the software is basically stock Android so it's quite snappy, and the screen is satisfactory. Battery life seems to be ok, with enough power to last a whole day and charging is quite quick. The only real negatives I see is that the SIM/MicroSD card tray is a pain to use (which will only be an issue for those who swap phones a lot) and Wifi is 2.4 only (not 5). No, there is no way that this can be compared with a high end phone, but for the price it will do everything that probably 98% of phone users need. It will be interesting to see how many peopple keep buying $700 high-end phones now that American cell phone companies aren't playing the subsidy game anymore and people realize how much their free or $199 phone really costs.\n",

      "Though it's only been 24 hours, I am super impressed by the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 4.7 inch smartphone (name is terrible though). This is a great time for affordable, mid-range, unlocked, no-contract smartphones. This phone slots in between the two models of the 3rd generation Moto G. Other than the RAM (1.5 GB vs 2 GB), it's very similar in specs to the more expensive Moto G model but at the price of the less expensive Moto G model (for now). I bought the Alcatel instead of the Moto G because it has a smaller, sleeker design (4.7 inch vs 5.0 inch screen and half as thin) and terrific front-facing stereo speakers. The screen is sharp and the speakers are very loud! The Idol 4.7 looks similar to the old Google Nexus 4, which I owned, but slimmer and sleeker (and more plasticy). It's a little smaller than an iPhone 6 despite having the same screen size, and about as thin. The Moto G has much more durable build and is waterproof, and I suspect, better support. Both the Alcatel and the Moto G make great backup or travel phones, and also starter smartphones for teens. They can also be very solid everyday phones for most consumers. As the wireless companies move away from contracts and subsidizing phones, I wonder whether more folks will start moving to some of the mid-range phones. Many folks have been paying $600-800 every two years for new phones without really knowing it. Perhaps Apple will be safe with its high-end clientele--at least for now--but companies like Samsung are very vulnerable. These $200 phones are more than good enough for the typical user--with performance comparable to the flagship phones from two years ago. I worry a bit about durability given the materials it's made out of. I should probably buy a case, but the phone is so sleek and attractive that I kind of don't want to put one on. Five stars for the amazing value! The Quality to price ratio for this phone is terrific.\n",

      "This phone has blown away my expectations. In a world full of phablets and cell phones that seem to just be getting larger and larger (and more and more expensive as well), it's becoming seemingly harder and harder to find a small phone that will actually perform. This phone does just that, and does it well.Initially I had owned an LG G4. I thought about it and realized, man this is insane that I am spending $600+ on a cell phone. I decided to return the LG G4 and give the Alcatel Idol 3 5.5 a try. While I loved the phone, it was still larger than I was hoping, and the 4.7 had not yet been released. Then one day I checked Amazon, and the 4.7 was out, so I made the exchange (and I couldn't be happier).People may complain about the specs when compared to some current flagship phones. Are they as good? No. But here's the thing, just a year and a half ago or so, if you saw the specs on this phone, they would have blown you away. Think about the flagship phones from a year or two ago. Were they bad, slow, etc? No, they were top of the line. This phone has the same specs, if not better, that those phones had. That being said, I have not experienced a single hiccup with this phone yet. No lag when switching screens or apps, no delay in taking pictures, no freezing or apps crashing. So ask yourself, do I really NEED a phone with specs that the $600-900 phones are offering?Pros:Screen - It's beautiful. Is it 1080P? No, and it doesn't need to be. At 4.7\" 720P is gorgeous, and looks just as nice as my LG G4 did. Know what is awesome about the screen being 720P? Battery life. The \"lower\" resolution will greatly improve battery life.Sound - The JBL front facing stereo speakers are magnificent. The sound is very loud, and very clear. Watching music videos, listening to music, and even the alarm are all very impressive with the volume and clarity. The JBL headphones that come with the phone also have excellent sound and come with different size earbuds to ensure a good fit.Speed - It's fast. There's no lag when switching apps, browsing the web, multitasking, sending emails, etc. One review I read elsewhere of the phone stated that when typing, the phone would sometimes lag and have to \"catch up\" to his typing. I am a very fast typer, and I have yet to experience this, so YMMV.Size - Perfect. Everything can be done with one hand. It fits well in your palm. Very thin.Camera - 13MP rear, and 5MP front. Both take excellent photos. Most importantly to me, they both take photos QUICKLY. I have a one year old, and having to wait 2-3 seconds after pressing the capture button will often times make me miss the shot, or have them end up blurry. The Idol 3 takes it almost instantly 95% of the time.Battery Life - Very impressed. Having the \"slower\" processor, and the \"lower resolution\" screen, both help to improve the battery life greatly. I have been using the phone pretty much non stop since getting it. I am a heavy texter, social media user, and I use the music player with both a bluetooth speaker and a bluetooth stereo headset for 2+ hours a day. I have been setting the phone up and redownloading all the apps on my previous phones, so I have been on it constantly. End of the day it still has plenty of charge left to it. I imagine the average user will have no problem getting through a day, and a heavy user may be able to as well.Cost - Can't be beat, obviously. $179 for this phone is an absolute steal.Cons:Brand - Not because Alcatel is bad, but because it isn't popular. This means little 3rd party support for accessories and whatnot. Currently the only tempered glass screen protector available on Amazon is by Mr. Shield, and the fitment is very poor. There are not a lot of cases available at this time. Hopefully this will change as more people realize what a gem this phone is and actually start buying it.Overall, this phone is amazing and well worth your money. I can't imagine what you would be doing that requires a phone that costs $600 more than this phone, honestly. The size is perfect, it's fast, the sound is incredible, and the battery life has been awesome. Alcatel has a real winner in this phone. The only competition I see at this price point would be the new Moto G, however I love the form factor and design of the Alcatel.\n",

      "Amazon service is excellent. Hence this review deserves atleast 1 star.I heard about this model in Feb 2015 when it was announced in CES. I was very much interested just because of form factor (I am not a fan of 5+\" and hefty phones). Was waiting to buy since then.. I think it was released in UK region in June then in US in September. Considering 5.5\" phone was priced at $199 for initial launch, I was hoping 4.7\" will be priced at $150 but it didnot. But I bought at for 180+ tax anyway.1) Though it was good initial days, battery drain (10% in 10 mins during non-usage of phone) and constant reboot (especially using camera) made me to return and get second phone.2) Second phone did not turn on et all. Did a factory reset and was able to turn on. Worked fine for 3-4 days and alas again same problem as above. Could not resist to return it back. Amazon is good in this process and hence I would buy from Amazon knowing my purchases are protected.For some days in October, this product was not available. There was notice \"there is some problem in inventory.. we will let you know when resolved\".. Not sure I got two defective items. I did noticed few good feedback on this phone here but somehow both phones didnt work for me. Good buy Alcatel.\n",

      "This was a replacement after my alcatel idol 3 5.5 was stolen. I didn't like the 5.5 due to it's size and had been thinking about replacing it, but couldn't justify buying another phone for no reason. I always found the 5.5 a bit too large for my hands and for my pockets.The 4.7 is perfect for my hands but is slightly slower than the 5.5. The slowdown is barely noticeable, this phone also doesn't have a release yet for the latest version of android, however it works perfectly out of the box for everything I do. This phone has no bloatware other than an antivirus program and a couple of other small apps that are easily removed. It's about as pure of an android experience as you'll get out of the box. For the price, build quality and general ease of use, I highly recommend this for anyone who isn't into iphones.\n",

      "This phone is awful with its performance and the configuration which was mentioned in the product description is just on papers looks like nothing works. Below are the issues I'm facing 1. Battery sucks big time, I made sure I had 100% battery before I went to bed and morning the reading on batter power was just 37% left. There was no activity on the phone but battery drains for no reason. 2. LTE never worked so far (Please don't argue, I was able to get LTE speed with other cell phone with the same service provider) and also network drops and gets back again,this never happened with my age old android phone. 3 Phone's performance sucks, hard to believe that the configuration they have mentioned can choke to perform with hardly 2 applications installed newly with the phone(I have no games in phone and I just bought this phone 2 days back)PS: The outlook of the phone looks good and the sound is good (Thanks to JBL) but I'm surprised that amazon sells very cheap below par phone which don't perform as per the description. I love to shop with amazon with some confidence but not with doubts.****************************************************Update - things turned worse to worst!!!Below is the email sent to Amazon.I have issue with my phone it's not connecting with my phone network. From the day two when I got this phone I'm having issue with battery and I have also registered for return but unfortunately I didn't return due to circumstance now the situation is really worse as I'm not seeing signal reception with this phone. My friends, office colleagues and my manager started complaining that most of the time my call was hitting the voice mail, initially I thought it was an issue with my carrier but last month I figured out its the problem with the phone and now for the last couple of weeks this phone is not even attempting to connect, I'm using my 2009 Samsung basic smart phone now, with which I'm able to place and receive calls. It's a real nightmare and I have lost important interview calls as well because of this Alcatel phone. I have taken pictures for ref. Comparing my old Samsung and this Alcatel phone, but I'm unable to add here. Please help me on this regard. I just bought this phone because it was sold by Amazon by itself. Thanks!\n",

I almost bought the nexus 5x, but then i saw you could update this to Android 6. That's when I bought it. It has a very nice, vivid, bright display, and the JBL speakers are good and loud. It has decent battery life, especially if you just watch an occasional YouTube video. 4G LTE works well, and its fast on wifi too. I get hi fps on Riptide GP 2 on high settings, and most other games and 360 video work well. If you really want an immersive experience with a small price tag, this is the phone I would recommend. Oh btw, update to Android 6 before you activate a service plan. I had to tweak APN settings after the update to keep using the phone service. It's just less hassle.

      "The phone has a sleek design and very comfortable. It froze on three occasions when I multitask end with several apps running and making a call. Happened on three different occasions during my one month use before my phone was stolen. All of my colleagues loved my phone and some wanted to place in orders. The sound is good (loud as appropriate), pictures very clear, built-in music player (turntable) fantastic. Gaming is also fun and the reversible OS a bomb! I have placed in another order to replace my missing phone already. Love the volume key as the camera shutter, it makes taking multiple shots so much easier and convenient. Camera can even be activated when screen is locked without unlocking the phone. Finally, I love the eye unlock but it is difficult using this feature at night or with insufficient light, which is complemented by another option (I.e pin code). Tried to lock phone many times by turning it over but never seemed to get this right, will try again though. Did not have much time to experiment with all the features of the phone before loosing it, but will surely spend more time with the next one. Too bad the 4.7 inch is single sim, I would have loved a dual sim 4.7 in. Also, I wished the inbuilt radio was wireless (could play without inserting the earpiece jack).

      "I'm very late on the smartphone bandwagon mostly because of plan prices and phone prices, but I found a $30/mo tmobile prepaid plan and all that was left was to find a phone. I did a lot (A LOT) of research over a few months, and landed on this model because of price, ram, reviews, and the availability of being on tmobile band 12.Since this is my first phone I don't have anything to compare it to, but I do love it, can't go back to a basic now. I've had it just approaching 2 months and no complaints with the software or usability. The call quality isn't so great, but it could be just that I work in an area that maybe have bad reception, and getting the sim card in was such a chore, the card kept falling out while trying to slide it back in - frustrating but i eventually got it in. The camera is fine, the display is great, the sound! my god the sound blew me away. Overall you can't go wrong for the price, and I bought a case with screen protector on amazon as well for $8. I highly recommend if you're looking for a phone with not much bloatware, enough ram and easy usability.\n",

      "I rarely write reviews but I believe I will be doing a greater good if I share my experience. I have had Iphone 4s, and Iphone 5s in the past. The reason I had iPhone in the past was its reliability and battery life. However, I had to switch to another phone when I broke my iPhone (I did not want to pay a premium price to get another phone) and was looking for an option with the best value for money.Alcatel one touch idol 3 4.7\" is a hidden gem. So far, I am EXTREMELY happy with the phone. The image quality is superb even though it has 720p screen resolution. I did not find any difference with iPhone or any higher resolution phone. In fact its the vibrant screen makes it so much more appealing than the rather neutral iPhone. Next, the sound quality of the speakers. Just Wow! Can't believe this phone has incredible speakers. Love watching netflix, youtube or listening to music in my phone. My wife cannot figure out if the sound is coming from the cell phone or the television. The next most important factor is the battery in this phone. Till now, I have observed that its life is as good as iPhone. This phone has more juice left towards the end of the day than an iPhone. I am surprised but thats the fact. Though the phone drains more battery when the navigation App is used, but again I won't complain about it. The Apps start and run very fine. There had been some occasion, when the app may not fire up. In that case, I would just free up the memory and it would work fine. This is hardly a concern.Another best feature of this phone is the form factor. The phone is so thin, that it immediately draws attention. Besides being thin, it very light and I do not feel it in my pocket. 4.7\" is the perfect size for the phone. Its not too big and not too small. Perfect for reading, watching, chatting and other day to day activities. I love this phone!I can't believe I had been wasting my money on iPhones when I had so much better option. Android really gives you a much better option to customize with widgets. I would suggest a new user to spend sometime to personalize this phone with better wallpaper, widgets, changing the default options for apps. Then you will love it as much as I do. Go for it and I would bet you will be amazed.\n",

      "Great phone for the cost! My wife doesn't like big phones, but doesn't want to be stuck with the typical cheap phone you have to get that has a smaller size. Calls are clear (HD calls supported on T-Mobile), screen is great quality for a phone this size, and the photos aren't too bad. Performance is way better than expected. The fact that it has 16GB of space and 1.5GB of RAM makes it really worth the money when compared to other phones in this price range (most have 8GB of space or only 1GB of RAM). The only downside for T-Mobile users is that it doesn't support Band 12, but we don't have that in our area, so it's not an issue. Very recommended for those who want a smaller but good performing phone!\n",

I dropped my cell phone which was definitely my fault, but only the corner was slightly cracked. When I woke up this morning after leaving my phone on the table overnight, the crack had spread throughout the top half of the screen and now the screen no longer works. It's $150 to replace the screen which is almost what the phone cost. This would be a great phone if not for the slow power on, the terrible call quality and the clearly terribly designed screen.

It is a very established brand, just hasn't had much luck breaking into the US market. But I suspect it will. Everyone is always asking me what my phone is. I had a Samsung before, and very much prefer this one. Do not feel like you are stuck with the very limited and expensive selection that the carriers provide.

I really enjoyed the screen size of his phone and didn't realize how much I did until I received mine. While all of the features are identical, and I couldn't be happier with the speed and ease of the phone, I wish I had purchased the larger screen size. The only other complaint that I have is how the photos look when taken indoors. While this still could be user error as I have only had the phone for about a week, the colors while taken inside seem to be a bit on the yellow side and not quite as sharp as I had hoped. Outdoor photos are wonderful, however! Another issue I have with the phone is with texting. While using the speech-to-text, if I need to correct an error, the very last word I say is repeated when I attempt to erase it. Not a big deal but it bugs me that I can't figure out why it does this.

I always tend to go \"middle of the road\" with my phone models, keep them 1-2 years, then get a new one. No flagships, but no junk, either. I've had LG, Samsung, Moto, etc. Most of the big players in the American market. I've never had an iPhone. I mention this to give a frame of reference on how my experience with cell phones was formed.When I was shopping for a phone, I just happened across this one. I had heard of Alcatel before, but never really considered any of their phones. The reviews of this particular model all seemed favorable, and at this price-point it seemed like a really solid choice. I won't re-hash the basic specs that you can read all over the internet, but I'll touch on some things that I've noted and liked/disliked:First impression of the phone: It has a very nice look about it. It's very thin and very light in the hand. The whole face of the unit is glass, and the sides are chromed plastic that give a pretty high-quality look, overall. No complaints.The phone comes with a surprisingly nice set of JBL in-ear headphones with mic and controller. I don't personally like this style of earbuds, but I did try them out and was definitely pleased with the sound quality of music, videos, and phone calls.After inserting my sim and SD cards, and charging up for a bit, I turned on the unit. It walked me through a pretty standard set-up routine, then I let it update Android, and put my usual apps on it. After a bit of personalization and sorting out un-used apps, this thing was ready to go. All the while, I noticed how nice the screen was and how apps popped open quickly, and just the overall positive impression the phone gave me.My observations:-To me the most important thing with a cell phone is... its ability to function like a phone. It seems weird to feel the need to state this, but I bet a lot of people rarely actually call people and talk to them w/ their cell phones. I have T-Mobile, and while I generally don't have reception issues, my neighborhood actually seems to be pretty spotty and my last phone would often drop calls in certain sections of my neighborhood. In my house, I would often have to use my wi-fi to make calls. The Alcatel works better than any other phone I've tried. It never dropped calls, crystal clear reception and people that I've talked to said it sounded like my calls were as clear as a landline.-The speakers on the Alcatel are really quite good, considering the size. Music sounds really nice on the speakers, and the output to headphones is above average. I like that there are 2 speakers, one at either end of the phone. Gives a bit of stereo effect if you're watching a video.-The picture quality of the screen is quite nicer than I expected. Colors are good, images seem decently sharp. Not as nice as a Galaxy, or iPhone, but... look at the price difference. I watched a bunch of Netflix, Youtube, etc. and I was really impressed overall.-I found the size of the unit to be almost perfect for me. I actually am a very tall guy, big hands, etc. and you would think that I'd like a bigger phone, but honestly, I like to be able to put the phone in my pocket, or be able to access all of the functions with one hand. Overall, it's just convenient for me to have this size. I really wish that phone manufacturers would settle down with making ever-larger phones and make some quality ones in this size.-The battery life is very good. I am not exactly a \"heavy user\" but I do make calls, check emails, check Twitter, and watch the occasional vid. I don't really do games, aside from the occasional solitaire. I leave the wifi and GPS on 24/7. I easily got over a day before needing to charge. If I had particularly light usage during a day and didn't watch any video, I could go nearly 40 hours before needing to plug-in.-I am not any kind of expert on Android's different iterations. I don't tweak my phones, or run different ROMS or anything like that. I can say that this phone's OS/ skin/ whatever didn't bug me. It just worked. No complaints. Seemed like standard Android fare that I'm used to, and nothing raised any flags for me. Just a decent system with things doing what I expected them to do.-The cameras, both front and back, are pretty good, I think. I take a lot of pictures for work and hobbies, but not for \"portraits\" or anything like that, more record-keeping. My requirements are pretty low. I can say that with good lighting, the rear camera took very nice pictures. If you're used to phones in this price range, the cameras are going to seem pretty normal. Nothing bad to report, just a solid camera.As for what I didn't like about the phone:-This is very subjective, and not really a big deal (actually it's bordering on silly of me, if I'm being honest): the power button was on the left side andthe volume rocker was on the right. This is opposite of every other phone I've had. I was constantly turning the phone off when I had been intending to change the volume. As I said, not a big deal, but just something I thought I'd mention.**AND NOW FOR WHY I RATED THIS 2 STARS:**-The astute reader will note that most of this is written in the past tense. I have returned the phone. As much as I like nearly everything about this phone, I experienced a deal-breaking problem with two of these.My first phone had a stuck pixel in the lower right section of the screen. When viewing lighter colors on the screen, it wasn't terribly noticeable. But when viewing darker materials or movies, or whatever, it really stuck out. I guess I'm pretty lucky in that I've never had a phone with any kind of problems, but I'm realistic. I know problems slip through the cracks sometimes. I just figured it was \"my turn\" to get a bad one. No big deal. Thank goodness for Amazon Prime, right? So I sent it back, and ordered another one. After a day or two of using the new phone, I noticed that the screen had a problem in roughly the same area as the other one, though it was a different problem. Lower right hand side of the screen. When running my finger across the screen, I'd get a distortion in that spot like when you press a flatscreen too hard. I wasn't pressing too hard, though. No different than any other area of the screen. While this defect was much less bothersome than the stuck pixel, it was still a problem, and I figured it would only get worse with time. So, back it went while it was still under the return period for Amazon.So, overall, I cannot recommend this particular phone. I really wanted to like it, but the fact that it had a screen problem on two of them in the same spot kind of spooked me off of it. I will keep my eye on the Alcatel Idol series and may try it again someday, as I really was impressed with so many aspects of this phone.\n",

      "I have no desire to give up this phone! Everything has made me happy so far. Sound Quality: the sound is amazing for a cell phone and perhaps its most bright quality. There are dual front speakers which produce LOUD, crystal clear music. You wouldn't think a phone could have the capability to have professional sound. Out of all the phones I've tested, this phone wins first place award for sound.Battery Charge: The battery is decent. I use the phone heavily and charge the phone about once a night, which is reasonable. Of course, if you're browsing the web and watching videos, the battery drains very quickly. But if you're listening to Spotify or something and put the phone on lock, the battery would last a much longer time. With light use, I've gone 2-3 days without charging the phone.Storage: 16GB is great. I've downloaded 10+ apps with ease, not to mention my picture Gallery which probably contains thousands of photos and a music library with maybe 200 songs. Most phones at this price contain a lower amount of storage.Durability: Unfortunately, this phone's glass is much more fragile since it does NOT use Gorilla Glass like many smartphones. I've had a few average drops which caused my tempered glass screen protector to crack. If you buy this phone, you MUST have a tempered glass screen protector.Overall, I love this phone and believe I will keep it for a long time. I highly recommend you purchase it. It's definitely worth paying more than $180 for! It has lots of storage, awesome sound, a very attractive & sleek design, good enough battery, and more.\n",

      "This phone hits all my requirements! Inexpensive, great cameras, front and rear, although there are definitely better ones out there, this does great.Very quick, only hangs up a few times and it is very minor. Love the front-facing speakers and dual microphones.My only complaints is that you can't uninstall the bloatware that comes pre-installed on the phone, but very minor.I've used the phone for about 6 months and its been great,. Although it's been very durable I HIGHLY recommend a case; I dropped it several times and it finally developed a small crack which doesn't respond to touch on the bottom quarter of the phone. My work around is enabling the reverse screen feature.Never used it before, but saved my wallet another purchase with that feature.\n",

      "Very good phone for the price. Switching from old Korean Samsung Note. I wanted something smaller and this 4.7\" IDOL 3 is perfect for me. The only downside is the new firmware installed on it which locked the boot-loader. I was hoping to flash a custom ROM on it, but so far unsuccessful. Can get root access to remove apps that are useless to me, but not many of those anyway. Very simple launcher interface with limited customization features Alcatel (TCL) gives us. Custom launcher is the answer to that (i'm using MIUI which I like personally, it gives me more customization options and its free). I would actually go with Huawei P8 Light instead (MIUI, design, and hardware) but it's missing this one Band frequency that i need to use overseas sometimes. P8 Light is my first choice for the phone under $200 to use in the States, but IDOL 3 is truly Global. That's the only reason it's not P8 light on the other end of the line of whoever is talking to me :) I'm happy either way. My money spent well.\n",

      "Iv'e had the phone for around a week now and just love it. From the form factor to the amazing front firing speakers to the intuitive stock android lollipop interface. I am using it on cricket wireless and everything just worked right away once i popped my sim card in. Wifi and LTE reception are on par or possibly superior to the LG G2 i replaced. Battery life on standby isnt quite as good as my G2, but while actually using the phone (watching videos especially) it mops the floor of the G2 in terms on on screen time. This is due to the lower res (but still very nice) screen and lower power snapdragon 410 CPU. Dont let the lower power fool you, ive yet to run into any scenario the phone hasnt performed just as well as my G2, which on paper is twice as fast. Just a heads up to buyers of the 5.5\" model (too big for my tastes, but seems to be the preferred size nowadays) is that it is coming to cricket wireless nov 6th for 149.00 bucks, 100 bucks off retail. Mind you it wont be unlocked, this would just be for people using cricket, and as a cricket customer i have only good things to say about them (they use ATT towers, they are the best MNVO by miles).The only con i can come up with on the phone is that it does not beep at you when fully charged, but the LED light goes off after its been at 100% for a couple minutes. I remedied this with an app called Gsam for the app store, now my phone beeps when it hits 100% :)In my opinion this blows away the competition (looking at you moto g) for the money, 16gb storage and 1.5gb memory really put it head and shoulders above other phones in this price range. Not to mention the better screen, absurdly loud speakers and overall dainty form factor (for a phone in 2015).Trust me, you will not regret this purchase, especially if you are looking for a phone under the \"norm\" 5\"+ form factor.\n",

      "Great product! I'm loving the smaller phone. It's a breath of fresh air from all these phablets and near phablets. I guess I'm in a minority for wanting a smaller phone. Battery life is great and performance is really good. I can't see any lags navigating through menus. I don't play games on my phone so I'm not sure how good the graphics processor. It has outstanding standby time. The screen is great even under sun light. The phone is very light and it produces incredible sound from its dual stereo front facing speakers. The screen is very crisp despite not being 1080P (not a knock, anything below 5\" screen doesn't need a 1080P screen). I've had the 5.5\" version but found it a bit too big for my taste. This phone is perfect, it's even a tad bit smaller than an iPhone 6/6S. 16GB is fine paired up with my 64GB Sandisk memory card. I didn't even think about the Moto G 2015 because with 16GB it's already close to the Idol 3 5.5\" ~$250 price. I'm not so worried about updates. As long as there are security patches and the apps work, then it's fine.\n",

      "We bought two of these phones (at full price, so this is an actual customer review, not one that may be biased by having received it for free or at a discount) a few months ago and still really love them. We spent quite a bit of time researching all of the options available both above and below this price range, and this phone looked to be a great value, and it really is. We are very pleased with our purchase. We use it with T-Mobile on one of their pre-paid plans and have had a very good experience with the phone and T-Mobile. We are also going to be traveling outside the country, and this phone comes unlocked and supports all of the bands that we need.Pros: The screen looks great, and is very bright and crisp. The camera takes very nice pictures and video. The phone fits nicely in the hand and looks and feels like a much more expensive phone. The build quality is excellent. We charge them after a couple days of normal use, so the battery seems to last a respectable amount of time. The sound, as other reviewers have mentioned, is just excellent. This thing can really put out some sound, and gone are the days of not being able to hear your phone ring! Playing music on it sounds great, and is stereo (one speaker at each end of the phone). The phone is reversible, with a microphone and speaker at each end, so it doesn't matter which way its facing when you pick it up to answer it, the phone will just take care of it based on the orientation using the gyro sensor. This isn't really a must have feature, but it is kind of nice. It plays videos (such as YouTube) very well, and it feels very smooth and responsive in every app we've tried. The value for the money is great, and we would still be very happy with it if we paid more.Cons:Wish it supported dual sim cards instead of just one, but you get a microSD card spot instead, so not too bad and most people probably only need one sim card slot anyway.Wish the volume could be adjusted in smaller increments, but this isn't the phone's fault, it's an android thing and not a deal breaker at all.In closing, we are very pleased with our purchase of two of these phones and would quickly and happily buy them again. If you are looking for a great unlocked GSM phone and don't want to pay an arm and a leg, then give this one a try. We highly recommend it!\n",

      "This seems to be a great little phone.When I saw it would cost $700 to get a new Samsung to replace my old S3, I shopped around. I bought the Alcatel Idol 3 (4.7\") from Amazon and after a week am pretty much thrilled at how well it works.The setup had some bumps for me because my cloud files were not up to date. My advice here is to update your contacts, files (including downloads), and pictures before cluttering the new phone with junk So don't log in to your Google acount (yes, even just for email) until stuff is updated and synch'ed up on the old phone.Also, perhaps because the Alcatel phone is \"unlocked\" and is not a service provider's proprietary device, it does not wake up in your hand knowing how to handle internet data. When you enter an in-range WiFi password, the Internet will work fine. To get it to work when you do NOT have WiFi, you will need to setup the mobile networks. This might be as easy as selecting your; provider in settings:(wireless networks - more - mobile networks - access point names - and then either select yourprovider.) You might need to enter the info manually if your provider is not listed. I found listings online by searching for \"AT&T Alcatel APN settings\" but didn't need it because my carrier is AT&T and there was a preconfigured choice as I described earlier.The \"unlocked\" feature is great because it means the phone works with SIM chips from any provider. So if I switch from AT&T to Verizon, Sprint, or any other service provider, this phone will work instantly as soon as I insert the chip. Also, if I travel to a foreign country -- in addition to being able to function on multiple networks --, I will be able to buy a chip for any country and put it into my own phone. If you have travelled, you know what I am talking about. Using your own phone is wonderful in foreign countries.NOTE: My phone accepted a memory chip in addition to the SIM; I see you CAN get a dual SIM option; which I do not understand. The little chip carrier can removed by pushing a paper clip into the tiny hole on the left side of the phone. The little tray slides all the way out. The chips do not fit snugly, but must be sort of balanced or set carefully and then inserted gently. I was actually surprised when it worked because the whole process seemed to require more faith than skill. The phone is so small and compact, it is easy to forgive this space saving compromise.I haven't compared the camera, but it seems fine. I got accustomed to popping the back off my Samsung and just dropping in a newly charged battery, but the Alcatel is sealed. I guess if the battery dies I will need to send it in for service or just replace the whole thing.In general, I think there are enough good reasons to give this phone a try and it is a low risk. Alcatel also makes a 5.5\" phone, so if you want a bigger unit, it's an option.I know this sounds almost evangelical, but I do pay attention to details. Seems like a winner to me.\n",

Hands are small so not all that easy for one handed use with my case. Love the speakers up front. Makes watching my shows on Netfilx that much more enjoyable. The UI is a little laggy at times, but that is compared to almost stock android on the Moto G. Compared to a friend's Samsung with TouchWiz, I get just a few less hangs up. The camera works for me (again, coming from that Moto G), but I have used much better (that Note 4 cam, wow!). I am truly impressed and would recommend it easily.\n",

      "Decent phone for the money, but if you are used to flagships, prepare to embrace the lag. The UI lags severely even with hardly any apps running.Pros: - Screen. Very bright and colorful 1080p display. - Speakers. JBL audio working great. Plenty loud - MicroSD. Great to have. Allows apps natively installed to the card. Great feature with only 16 GB on board. - LTE. Grabbed LTE on ATT no problem.Cons - LAG. SOOO BAD! sent it back within a few hours of getting it. The Zenfone 2 blows it away in this category. - No fast charging. This might be able to be overlooked, but after having a Nexus 6 and the Zenfone, you get spoiled by it.Overall if you can deal with the lag and sluggishness, it's a great phone. I don't game on my phone as I have a tablet, which is why I tried this phone thinking it can do daily tasks fine but the UI lagging just got to me. I think the culprit is it only being clocked at 1.5 ghz, even the lower end zenfone @ $199 is 1.8 ghz. for $50 more, go with the Zenfone 2 with 4gb of ram and 64gb on board. Yea, the speaker sucks on the Zen, but the display is still pretty good and it runs so much better.\n",

      "So far, I pretty much dislike this phone (\"hate\" is too strong a word).All-in-all, I'm fairly unimpressed, and I don't understand the \"hype\" about this phone; last month when it was introduced, I even saw it featured on a local TV News segment. I suppose it's major draw is it's relative affordability compared to the Big Brand Name smartphones?CONS:I've been looking for WEEKS to find a complete User Manual because the manufacturer DOESN'T HAVE ONE. It seems that there are a lot of things/features/functions not covered in the Quick Start Guide.The battery life is unimpressive; my 3-and-a-half year old Samsung Note (the original, first generation Note) has the same battery life as this.Why the heck is the Ringtone/notification so FREAKING LOUD even at the lowest setting?!Why can you NEVER turn-off the vibrate/buzz regardless of turning it off in all the settings that give you the option of turning it off? You can either have the lowest (but pretty darn loud) volume set for ringing and notifications, or vibrate/buzz. There is no \"silent\". Silent = buzz.Even with the option of the LED Notification light, which is meant to preclude the use of buzz.PROS:Yes, the display/screen quality and resolution are very nice.The overall quality of the manufacturing is excellent and exactly like any of the Big Name Brand expensive phones (you cannot tell that it is a \"low-priced\" phone at all, it looks and feels great).I prefer big phones/phablets and find this phone is a nice size.I cannot comment on the JBL/Harmon sound; I have heard only ringtones and notification tones and buzzing, which seem the same quality as any modern, good-to-best-quality name brand smartphone.In fairness, some of the things I don't like I suspect are just my own fault for not learning Android 5/Lollipop completely yet - and maybe a lot of stuff I just really hate about Lollipop...But I'm comparing this to another family member's new phone that runs Lollipop and this Alcatel phone has some very weird and undesirable features/functions, and is missing some of the more desirable ones (for my uses).It could also very well be that this is simply not the right kind of Smartphone for me.I use my phones for Internet if needed when I'm not near a PC, messaging, the occasional actual phone call, and photos;never as a music player or for watching TV/movies/videos or as an eReader (that's what my massive LED HD TVs and tablets are for).\n",

      "My first impressions for this phone is pretty good. I'm happy to see the amount of flagship phone qualities that this packs for under $300. I previously had the Samsung Galaxy S4 and I’m happy with the switch so far. I’m loving the 5.5 inch screen for browsing the web or watching videos although it’s going to take some time for me to adjust to the size of the phone. The dual facing front speakers are great, it’s much louder and clearer than the S4’s speaker. The near stock Android user interface was nice and smooth with some lag when opening up new applications. However, there are some problems that keeps this phone away from getting a 5 star rating. The power button is placed too high to operate without adjusting your hands and I thought that the double tap to power feature would help alleviate this problem but it doesn’t work most of the time when the screen is off. One more problem is the video recording quality looks low quality, during playback it’s like watching 360p or 480p videos that is scaled up to 1080p. These problems can probably be fixed with new updates, but until then I’ll leave the rating at a 4 star for now. Here are some other pros and cons.Pros:- Bright and clear display- Great dual front facing speakers- Pretty smooth user interface- Good reception (I had no issues connecting this phone with the AT&T network)- Camera takes decent pictures for the price- Slim body- Reversible screen and call featureCons:- Power button placement- Double tap power feature is unreliable at times (subject to change)- Poor quality 1080p video recording (subject to change)- Some lag when opening application- Lack of IR blaster- Non user replaceable battery- Radio feature gets terrible receptionOther note:- The phone call sound effect volume gradually gets lower when you call someone. I don’t know if this is intentional or a defective speaker. However, when the person answers their phone the volume seemed fine throughout the call.\n",

I bought 3 units of the idol 3 for me and my 2 brothers, I bought 2 of them in July 2015 and bought the third in Jan 2016.I bought them all from Amazon and had them shipped to me where I live in the Middle East.The phone was a bit laggy and had its problems, but hey you can't complain for $250! However, the lack of support was truly shameful, we were stuck in Android 5.0.2 for a really long time!Anyway that is not my problem here, my problem is that I think the idol 3 has huge manufacturing problem!Few weeks ago, my screen cracked right under the headphone jack, what made things worst is that I couldn't use the phone once the screen was cracked, because I thinks the digitizer is fused with the screen in this phone to make it thinner. I thought I somehow was the reason that the screen cracked, but guess what?! Yesterday my brother phone cracked too, In the right same spot where my phone cracked, right under the headphone jack!

      "I bought this phone about a year ago and was initially very happy. Since the most recent update, however, it is slow and at times will not read my SIM card. As in, I'll be in the middle of a conversation and the call drops, I look at my screen, and it says \"No SIM card installed.\" The touch screen has also gotten buggy; sometimes, you have to beat it half to death to get it to engage, other times, it calls people when something inside my purse first turns it on and then brushes against the screen. Bizarre.Having said all of this, I am on TMobile, so some of these issues may be related to the recent removal of band 12 compatibility. I definitely notice a huge drop in the call quality since the most recent update, to the point that I want to throttle the thing out the window. Even with a headset (I have tried 4 different ones), people on the other end complain that they can't hear me.As to the screen being fragile, that has not been my experience. I have dropped the phone many, many times (often onto a concrete floor) and it hasn't broken, and I haven't noticed any scratching on the screen. I don't have any kind of case on it and it swims around in my purse unprotected, so there's that.I think this is probably a really good phone for the money -- if you're not on TMobile. I really enjoyed it initially and felt a little smug that I had gotten such a great phone for such a low price. I am buying something else, though, because I've lost patience with the call quality and other strange bugginess since the update.\n",

      "Seemed like a great buy at the time. Having owned it for a while now I see 4 major shortcomings:1. Useless as an alarm clock. Completely unreliable. Sometimes goes off at the right time. Many times does not. Takes away half the functionality.2. OS will not grant many apps write permissions to the SD card. The app will ask for it, send you to a system screen, and the system screen won't show the SD card. I call support and they say it's the app's fault (these are apps downloaded tens of millions times like rocket player and ES file browser). They say, with a straight face, that I should only use the stock apps they provide. I was stunned.3. As pretty as the big screen is, it is NOT healthy for my eyes. I was hoping to read more on it. I have stopped doing that. No sub for a good screen (eg of a decent size tablet) for comfortable reading.4. Likely will be stuck on Lollipop 5.0.2 forever. Not even 5.1.1. Very disappointing.Would not recommend.Late edit: After upgrading to Android Marshmallow problems 1,2 and 4 went away. Thanks for updating, Alcatel.Now it's a nice, cheap, (slowish), big, reliable smart phone. I'm happy.Hope this phone lives to see Android N.\n",

      "Wow! What a gem!! My old Samsung S4 died after many years of faithful service so I looked into getting the latest and greatest Samsung. The price of a new S7 immediately had me searching for \"best cheap android phones\". I came across this Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 and bought it. NO REGRETS! The size is perfect for what I was looking for. I was able to sync the applications that I wanted back to this new phone. Performance is acceptable and the price is exceptional. The camera is not the best, however for what I need, it is more than what is required. I highly recommend this for anyone who would like to get a nicely appointed phone and not feel like you are getting robbed.\n",

      "UPDATE:I installed the new Marshmallow update yesterday and OH MY GOD is it smooth. It's has so much less lag it's like I have a new phone!Unfortunately updating to Marshmallow removed the ability to use T-Mobile Band 12 LTE (you still get LTE on other bands) which you can't change unless you Root your phone and flash the previous radio software. But I think it's 100% worth the trade off. Get this phone now! If mine breaks I think I'll get another, no joke.----------------------First off this is the most beautiful phone I've ever owned and the speakers and screen are to die for.But the processor/RAM/internal memory/software leave a lot to be desired. It's soooo slow at times, and I usually can't have more than a few apps open at once if I want it to work at all. I'm only keeping it because I love the speakers and I'm gonna be getting the IDOL 4S when it comes out because it has specs I have been wanting for 2 years.Everything I mentioned as a downside are improved in the 4S, double the internal memory, 3GB RAM, SD 652 processor which is better than the SD 808!!! And newer software of course.I just hope I can sell the idol 3 for $100 to put towards the new one. I still think this isn't a bad phone for under $200, especially if you love good front facing speakers. but I hate how slow it is.\n",

      "False Advertising! T-Mobile Users Beware! I purchased two of these phones (The first in June 2015 from Amazon and the second one in Sep 2015 directly from Alcatel who used Amazon to fulfill the order). My Primary reason for the purchases was support for T-Mobile Band 12 and the price point. Well, for the last couple of months, the signal quality has been noticeably worse,...missing calls, texts etc. I tried to think back to what changed and I remembered an OTA update in Janurary from Alcatel. After some research, I discovered that Alcatel's Janurary OTA firmware update REMOVED support for T-Mobile band 12! They actually took away the feature that was my primary reason for purchase. No warnings, no communications. It was done secretly and now I have two phones that perform very poorly. When I contacted them their response was basically \"Screw you...too bad.\" I have read they have no plans to update it and make it work. It's bringing your new car to the dealer for an oil change and them removing your transmission without telling you leaving you with a useless hunk of metal. Shame on you Alcatel/TCL and Amazon! I would hope that you would make this right somehow, but not holding my breath.\n",

      "Switched from a OnePlus One. Is it worth the switch? depends. This is a good mid-range phone. Main reason why I switched phones is because this phone supports band 2, 4, and 12 on T-Mobile's LTE network. Where as the OnePlus One only supports band 4. Although the OnePlus One's performance is better, it does have bug issues with both Cyanogen 12 (CM12), and their Oxygen OS versions of Android 5 Lollipop. Plus, people on the other end were complaining they can't hear me clearly.Pros:- Good screen quality (Bright)- Good sound quality (with JBL dual front facing speakers)- Plastic build does not feel cheap. Has nice \"brushed\" effect- Band 2, 4, and 12 support on T-Mobile's LTE Network- Battery lasts whole day- Expandable storage with MicroSD card up to 128GB- 13MP back, 8MP front camera- Reversible- Decent quality earbuds included- Good call quality, other person can hear me clearly- $249 priceCons:- Screen quality is on the bright side. It doesn't get dark enough when turned all the way down. (had to use a screen filter app to make the screen dimmer than the lowest setting)- Camera sound/mic quality is not good.- Performance issues (can lag and freeze with certain apps. Its a software issue. Alcatel has sent out an update which helped it a little, but it still has not been completely resolved. Hoping Alcatel will send out another update soon. SnapChat has noticeable performance issues. The SnapDragon 615 has enough power to handle the performance, since lower ranged phones can handle SnapChat with no issues.)- Alcatel's light skin over Android Lollipop is ok, but it would be better if they left it stock Android.\n",

      "I love this phone so much. As a former alcatel oneouch S pop owner, I was kind of unsure if this was the phone for me (as it had stopped working). But after watching and reading countless reviews, I said why not? and can i say best decision of my life! I had a budget of $250 so it was right on the budget but has awesome quality. I was so surprised! Not only does it have the newest form of android (lollipop) but really cool features like the reversible feature. It also has great icons and the screen quality is great. There is a JBU mix feature that has this dj mixing feature which was cool. On all the reviews I watched everyone complained about lag, I played about 15 levels of cooking fever and it didn't stutter once. The phone is also really light weight even though is waay bigger than my onetouch S pop it is still much lighter. It also has a good camera, both front and back. Awesome phone and awesome price.\n",

      "I’m not going to get into too many explicit specs on the phone because I am trying to review this from a real-world, does-it-work? perspective. I don’t care about benchmarks, I care about how I was able to use this phone in my everyday life. If you want every technical detail, you can go here.Hardware/ScreenThe Idol is a 5.5 inch phone with a 1080p IPS screen. The back of the phone has a plastic back, but not removable (so no battery swapping). There are some faux-chrome accents that go around the device and the speakers (dual-front facing, more on that later) are at the very tippy-top and bottom of the phone. The phone feels pretty nice in the hand and wasn’t hard to hold.The screen is fantastic and one of the best features of the phone. Alcatel uses some buzz-words to describe it (TECHNICOLOR!) but the simplest way to put it is that the screen is vivid, bright and crystal clear. It’s not flagship level for 2015, that would require a QHD screen, but what it lacks in resolution vs. something like the LG G4 or Samsung Galaxy S6, it makes up for by being $300+ cheaper (off contract) than any other flagship device. Simply put, the Idol’s screen is so nice, it doesn’t feel like it should be on a phone so cheap.My other favorite hardware feature is the inclusion of a MircoSD slot next to the sim card slot (which are both in a tray that’s ejected from the left side of the phone). I basically can’t buy a phone without extra storage because I prefer to keep as much music downloaded to my phone as I can, to avoid streaming (either due to data restrictions or having access to it when I am in areas with poor coverage). The storage is up-gradable to 128gb, which goes on top of the 16gb the phone offers out of the gate (almost 10gb usable out of the box).Sound QualityThe quality of sound I get from a smartphone is critical to me. I’d say I place listening to music/podcasts as the number one use I have for a smartphone. My HTC One has audio tuned by Beats, which then morphed into Boomsound, but whatever you want to call it, it sounds great coming from the device or listening via headphones.I’m happy to say that the sound quality is another feature here that seems like it would come from a more expensive phone. Here, Alcatel touts sound tuned by JBL with an option to turn that sound optimization on or off under the settings. I much prefer the sound with the feature on and I’d say it easily rivaled my HTC One for sound quality both when listening from the device or with headphones.There’s a speaker on the top and bottom of the phone, which is, in part, necessary for their upside-down feature. Basically, you can pick up the phone for a call and it will be properly orientated regardless of it being right side up or not. I don’t find the feature to be something that was of great use to me, but I can see the function.Regardless of that feature, having two speakers on the phone is part of what makes it sound great. Some newer phones, like the Asus Zenfone 2 have what looks like dual front speakers, but in reality only one speaker is at the top or the bottom. The Idol gets LOUD when listening from the device. Louder than my One. I love this feature because it makes for listening to music or podcasts in the shower nice and easy to hear. The speakers don’t even seem to become over-burdened when at full volume.Sound quality is on par with the screen, giving the Idol 2 features that feel to be of much better quality that you’d expect from a phone in this price range.UsabilityAndroid Lollipop comes standard (I think I had 5.0 out of the gate) and is near stock. Most of the non-stock features are removable. I’ve grown to love stock Android vs. any skinned version of it, so that was a determining factor for me with the Idol.The general, day-to-day use of the Idol is perfectly adequate, but not overwhelmingly speedy. This was the first part of the phone that felt like “you get what you pay for”. That’s not to say it’s not functional, because it very much so is. Where as I found the lack of speed to be a factor in selling my Moto G, I had no such thoughts with the Idol.There are no issues with multi-tasking, I was easily able to switch between music, maps, a browser and a game. Things like that are just a bit pokey to respond. Not pokey in the sense that it takes 30 seconds of your life from you, but sometimes a program might take 1 or 2 seconds longer to open than you’d see on a phone with a top-of-the-line processor/RAM setup. Those 1 to 2 seconds seem annoying sometimes, but that just speaks to me and my lack of patience. The reality is that this phone works perfectly well and should for the vast majority of users.Call quality is perfectly adequate, but I am probably not someone who should even speak to that. I spend, maybe, 10 minutes a week using my smartphone as an actual phone, but those 10 minutes work very well. I come across clearly as does the person on the other end. The speakerphone has the benefit of the dual speakers, just as a song or podcast does.I feel like the hardware buttons would have been nicer if placed a littler lower. Due to the phone’s size, I had issues with pressing the unlock button with one hand. Not massive issues, since I’ve almost always used two hands with my phone, but for people who like a one hand device, this might not be it (if I’m being honest, I think this is a stupid reason to or not to buy a phone, I tend to just adapt to whatever device I select, but to each their own). The USB port and headphone jack are where you’d expect them, on the bottom and top, respectively.Battery LifeAnother nice feature with the phone is battery life. I don’t consider myself a super heavy user of screen time on a basic day, so I’d easily get home with 50+% after work and make it to bed with 30+% or more. Having the phone on a recent vacation where I was heavy on camera use and GPS I found myself slightly more nervous with battery life, but the phone charges very quickly (60% in 40 minutes, I think) so driving 10 minutes from one place to another, I could give a quick boost and take that nervousness away. Overall, very solid battery life for my (and I think most people’s) usage.CameraHere we get a 13MP rear-facing camera with a 8MP front-facing camera for selfies. All in all, I was very happy with the camera performance. In well lit situations, shots where clear and crisp. Some low-light situations mad for poorer quality pictures, but that’s every camera phone, ever. The biggest struggle for the camera was actually on a cloudy day. I used the camera’s time-lapse video function to film a boat trip I took on Lake Superior and you can see that the phone struggles with it’s focus and makes the land look rather dark against the cloudy sky. This could be user error, however, I’m not sure.Like every other smartphone out there, there’s an HDR function in the menu to give a little more definition to your shots. I think it worked as well as one would expect, but I stuck with the camera’s auto mode for the most part. Check out this gallery here, here and here to see some shots in all sorts of lighting conditions.Other than having the sun blare straight into the camera lens or overly dark shots, I really liked what the camera gave me. Anything I see as a negative with the camera is just the reality of using a smartphone for your main camera due to convenience. They are never going to perform like the best point-and-shoot units, but to have decent performance is nice and the Idol is a step or two above decent.Final VerdictI don’t think you can get this much phone for the money you pay, anywhere else. The Idol is, very easily, worth the extra $70 you’d be spending over a Moto G. The other phone that was hot in the running for me was the Asus Zenfone 2 (4GB Ram Version) but I picked the Idol for its superior sound quality and screen, both of which I think are better than the Asus. I know that OnePlus has their 1’s at a lower cost right now, but the lack of a Mirco SD card took them out of the running for me, I keep a lot of music on my phone.Overall, there is a trade-off between these less expensive, off-contract phones. OnePlus and Asus focused on making a very responsive, powerful phone and Alcatel focused on a better media experience. I don’t think you can go wrong with any of those three options, but the Idol Onetouch 3 was easily the phone for me….…and I miss it. As I alluded to earlier, I am back to my HTC One. I got a little to into my desire to become Ansel Adams that I may or may not have dropped the Idol in a river in Northern Wisconsin. I’d love to get another Idol, but it’s not currently in the budget and I DO have a phone that works, even if I can’t update it. I plan to wait out until next year to see what the Onetouch 4 will bring. Alcatel made a statement with this device and I hope to see them continue making phones at a budget price with specs and usability that outweigh the budget price point.\n",

But other than that its great, didn't notice any lag unless i was closing a large amount of apps at once. Looking at my Nexus 6 that is about three times more expensive, I feel pretty impressed with this phone. Same stereo front facing speakers, and they sound great. The FM radio is a nice inclusion, wish more phones had this. JBL headphones are nice sound good, and was clearly heard during a phone call. Double tap to wake screen work very well, wish my Nexus 6 had this. It has a very premium feel and screen looks brighter and more vivid than my Nexus 6.

      "I am an iPhone freak. I was looking to add another phone(a moderately priced one as it'll only serve as my iPhone's 'assistant') with a different OS from apple's iOS. A phone with the android OS was my preferred choice. I gave up on my search because I didn't get what I needed in a moderately priced android phone till I saw a friend with the 4.7 inch version of the idol 3. I browsed through and was like 'whaaat, Alcatel did this'? The phone fast, has a good camera, has good speakers and good battery life, because after about 30 minutes of watching videos, the battery didn't drain as it would've on my iPhone 6. I bought one of the 4.7 for my personal use due to its cute size and 4 of the 5.5 to sell. In my country, bigger screen phones sells faster, plus the 5.5 is the better of the two in terms of performance. It's been about a year now and none of the buyers has called to complain about anything.

      "I love this phone for the price! This is my 4th Android phone over many years and by far the best yet. The screen is great, the sound is way better than any phone I've heard and the camera... it's no DSLR but hey, what do you expect for a phone? If you're expecting an iPhone 6s+ here, you may be disappointed. But for what most people use a phone for: Phone calls, check email or Facebook, look up something on the web, take a picture, it's just fine.I don't play games on this so I can't speak for the performance in that department. My guess is that you would want something a little more zippy if you're using graphics intensive apps.I have not experienced any issues with listening to audio (Pandora, PowerAmp, Google Music, Dogcatcher) or the bluetooth connection as some of the reviews may lead you to believe. I listen to music and podcasts using bluetooth to my car and a few pairs of bluetooth headsets with no stuttering or frequent dropouts. Audio quality is great over BT.The phone is updated regularly by Alcatel.Hate to say it, but sometimes things don't work out of the box. Sorry to hear that the customer service isn't great but again, you're more than welcome to spend $800 for an iPhone or Samsung if you want the best experience possible. I'll take my chances and save a bunch of cash, thank you! Going on 4 months with no issues on this one. Oh, if you're going to drop any phone, get a case! Just saying.\n",

      "I bought this phone for my daughter last June 14th and 90 days later, September 16th the phone is dead, no scratches or ding on the phone, nothing. It looks new because from day one it had hard case and film protector. Amazon warranty is over so my daughter called Alcatel almost 10 times to obtain the RMA, to send the phone to get checked and repaired. I like to know why a new phone dies after only 90 days? Nice apologize by Alcatel, but they have yet to send the promised email containing the return label, only providing excuses stating that they \"understand our frustration\". We need solution not excuses. It should be replaced by Alcatel, as it is truly a defective product, not just repaired.Summary: Phone died after only 90 days, Alcatel customer service has been sub-par, promising to provide a shipping label to get the phone repaired but never actually sending it.

      "I had a great hope for this product.This phone is far better than other phones in the same range, But after using this for a month I am bit disappointed. Here is my experience with this mobile.Good:> Nice screen. The screen is clearly visible in sunlight. Dont be fooled by other phones with great specs. This screen works.> Good battery life. With casual usage ( net, calling, youtube, small games, text ) this phone lasted for more than a day for me.> Awesome sound quality. With dual JBL speakers and headphones. The sound is just awesome. Call quality is also clear.OK:> Ergonomics is OK. With this screen size, holding the phone is bit difficult to hold and they have not provided any special software ( like asus zenphone ) to make it easy.> software. Pure android for most of the part.Bad:> Performance.Dont be fooled by 2GB ram and quad core CPU. This phone is laggy. its the deal breaker.> Camera: The autofocus of the camera is useless. By the time you click , the lens looses its focus and the image is blurry. Same with video.Terrible.>Software: Not much customization offered. Too little.Conclusion: With oneplus one and many other mobiles offering better specs and better performance this mobile is not a good choice to go at this point in time.\n",

It's a great phone for its price, the only thing that kind of dissaponted me was the camera resolution at low light or dark spaces it is just not good compared to my HTC camera. But overall happy with the purchase , I bought a second idol 3 phone after the first one cause it really worth it. Also double tap doesn't react so quick, as my HTC m8 but it's no big deal. Other thing I loved about the idol is the reverse screen. And the headphones JBL, just great add for this great phone.I'm an HTC user telling that this phone is nearly a high end class phone , it looks, feels,sounds just amazing. And battery life no worries you can end your day of usage and go home at night to charge it.Fully recommended.\n",

      "The camera on this was terrible. For a 13 MP camera, the colors in the pics were washed out and many of them were shaky, I suppose that's where the lack of image stabilization comes into play, especially with indoor photos. And the 8MP front facing camera when used indoors had so much noise I was simply shocked at the result. Black or shadowy areas were full of noise and even lighted spaces were fuzzy. My Samsung's 2.1 MP front camera outperformed the Idol 3 which was very surprising.In outside lighting the camera was merely decent, but some backgrounds would be washed out. Playing with the exposure helped some, but simply not enough. I also read that perhaps you could download a different camera app that would help with the faded issue, but that really shouldn't be necessary for a 13 MP camera. Also many tech reviews about the camera were positive, so either I had a faulty device or my standards are just way too high.I was really disappointed since the phone itself was very nice and had some nice features that I didn't really get to explore. Anyhow, I sent it back. I ended up biting the bullet and laying down the cash for the LG G5.\n",

Only thing is, I'm a beefy user which means I download a lot of apps.This phone can handle it but that paired with my 4000 photos and 30 videos makes the experience a bit difficult to enjoy.Overall if you don't have my situation then you'll be fine. This phone can power through the everyday tasks with a breeze. Doesn't lag. Unless you have my situation.Battery life in my situation will last me about 3 hours. Without my situation it has lasted about 12 hours. With heavy usage were talking 8 hours.

The screen doesn't scratch easily. The phone looks of high quality.The speakers are super loud and very clear. It is HiFi qualito ( Google it if you don't know what it means).

      "I got this at the current price of $250, which is still a good deal for what you get. As a T-Mobile customer, I wanted a phone that supports all the T-Mobile bands (since T-mobile coverage is not all that great as it is), which is what set this apart from the Zenfone 2. I really like the phone so far.Double tap to wake has worked for me every time. Some people have reported it not working for them all the time. It works best with the launcher it came with, so if you are using some thing else like the Nova launcher, it may not work without additional tweaks. Also remember that it needs a tap, not a gentle touch, so bend your fingers when you tap.Camera seems okay so far. Some have commented about the lack of a link to Gallery. The access to Gallery is still there. It is a little different going from Android 4 to Android 5. In 5, after you take a picture, you need to swipe from right to left to review the picture you just took. If you swipe again, you can see the previous pictures you took from Gallery.I recommend using Firefox as the browser and install an add-on like adblock to make it a little easier on the phone since the CPU in this is not the top-tier workhorse the more expensive flagship phones use.\n",

      "About as good value for money as there is on the current market. Lacks only a high-end processor (only important if you play demanding video games- I don't play any), and a few of those unnecessary \"features\" the big boys like to promote, to be equal to current flagships at almost 3x the price. Has all frequencies for AT&T and T Mobile, including LTE band 12 for the latter (which few other unlocked phones have at this point). Build quality is very good and the display is gorgeous.

      "For the price that the phone costs you definitely get much more than you pay for, but if you can afford to spend more, then this phone is not for you. I've had pretty much most flagship phones out there.I will start with what I dislike about the phone. 1)The lag does get annoying, but then again it is exactly the same lag that I had while using Note 4. Even galaxy s6 edge has one. I have to use those cleaning apps to free up so space in order to boost the performance. I also disabled animations in the developer mode. Still after all that, the lag is there. It is noticeable during typing when it becomes slow and keys don't register right away. 2)Next thing is battery, dies pretty quick, but even though there is no quick charge, it does charge pretty fast, on park with s6 and note 4. Battery also gets hot when using the phone with having few apps open in the background. 3) Knock knock feature doesn't work most of the time.So So things.1)Display is a hit or miss type of a thing. Colors are not as vibrant as I wish they were. Colors are a bit washed out. The screen to me does not look like it comes from a flagship phone, and it's just okay, but then again it is a $250 phone, which is what I always tell myself. I wish they gave option to adjust the tone of display in this device like samsung does. 2) This phone reminds of a nexus 6 and it's radios. LTE is here, but it's not as strong. Comparing phones side by side, s6 edge gives me speeds of download 70mb and upload of 30mb, while on idol 3 I get down 20 to 40 and upload 15 to 20ish. The speeds are okay, I have no issues with that. My issue is LTE signal is not strong, and a lot of times it drops to H+.Things I really like.1) Speaker is really good. 2) Comfortable to hold this device, and slim. 3) I think cameras are great. Way much better than Note 4, but not as good as S6 edge. 4) Charges really fast. 5) Call quality is great. 6) The size of the phone, just perfect.Overall this phone does deliver things that some even top phones don't. A lot of dislikes of mine can be fixed with a software update. For the price, it is definitely worth a buy.\n",

      "Just to be upfront I got this as a backup phone for my family to share for \"just in case\" moments. I got it on a pre-order one day sale of 199.00, and couldn't pass up a good deal like that. That being said, so far I'm pretty impressed. Doesn't have the best camera, but honestly its not really that bad at all-especially at the price I paid. I'm really appreciating the fact that the interface is simple and not cluttered. The settings menu is very easy to navigate, meaning it doesn't contain a bunch of crapware that no one uses or have an over done settings menu. Poor overall user experience, unwanted/unremovable carrier and OEM software, and overdone menus are contributing to dissatisfaction and to decline for some of the bigger manufacturers, but they just don't get it.The reversible phone screen feature's a cool little item also. Comes in handy when answering the phone and allows you to have your headphone jack facing the direction you want. The screen is surprisingly bright, crisp, and device seems very responsive and runs pretty smooth so far. It doesn't have all the power that my family's main phones have, but in real life use, it's powerful enough and seems to handle everything fairly well. Some little nitpicky things I don't like, and this is just me, and this is on ANY non pure Android phone, I don't like AM/PM showing on the lock screen- it just looks off centered. I also don't like AM/PM showing in the status bar. It's unnecessy visual clutter. Your common sense clues you in on the AM/PM status of the day and Google (Nexus) is the only one that gets that. Maybe at least an option to hide it. Don't like where the power or volume keys are placed, as I said earlier the camera is not the best, but for the most part it's actually not bad. I use Google's camera and edit it with Google Photos and the pictures come out pretty decent.Once encrypted you have no choice but to listen to the boot up sound not once- but twice. YAY! Great for when you turn your phone on in a quiet setting. Everyone around you is sure to appreciate the jingle and think happy thoughts. I don't know why OEM manufacturers think we need to hear boot up sounds and jingles. Decisions like this make owning a Nexus a must for me. All androids have weak and strong points, but not including the Nexus, most of them have a lot more dumb OEM annoyances that you have to deal with, but I digress. One of many of the biggest secrets to the success of the iPhone- just one. Start putting unnecessary apps from the carrier and stupid bleeps and bloops, startup sounds, etc on the iPhone and I guarantee you the complaints would come in droves. Could you imagine Verizon, AT&T or other carriers forcing apps and software on the iPhone that you couldn't remove? It would totally hurt Apple's sales and people would be in the streets with pitchforks, torches and knives... I'm digressing again.Also, the AOSP keyboard is NOT the same as the Google keyboard, at least mine isn't. Looks exactly the same, but the swype-like slide to text feature wont work for me even though I have it set properly in settings to do so. Had to actually install Google's real keyboard from the Play Store. Obviously a bug. Not a big deal, but worth noting.Besides, having Google's keyboard (or any keyboard from the store) also means it will get updated as needed from the actual store. That won't ever happen with most AOSP keyboards or OEM keyboard unless you get a system update. My keyboard having this glitch is a perfect example. It won't get fixed anytime soon.I do like the overall look of the device. It looks fairly thin and is very light. I ordered a tempered glass screen protector and a simple TPU case for it. I do like the expandable storage, I REALLY like the small bezels, I like that it doesn't have any unnecessary branding on the front of the phone, I like its simplicity, I like that it's not overdone in the software department, I like the price I paid, (although 249 is still a good deal). Really like the front facing speakers and sound. I like the double knock to turn on, which is necessary since the power button is awkward to press. I'm also impressed that the volume button presses adjust to the orientation of the screen. So volume up is always up, and down is down- regardless of orientation. The battery life is surprisingly good, and the camera is actually a bit better than I thought it would be and is more than adequate for basic use. Nice that they threw in HDR with it.I guess the only things I'm not gung-ho about is the cluttery AM/PM (as I overly mentioned), and the other items. It also charges very quickly using its own charger and cord. I used a Samsung plug on it, but it just got really warm and would barely charge, so it may be biased to its own chargers. I'm not sure how fast it would charge speed-wise with an LG, HTC, Motorola etc, or just a generic USB plugin. Anyways the charger and plug-in that it comes with appear to be very good quality. Even my teenage daughter who is always interested in the latest and greatest Android phones, thinks it's a pretty decent phone and that's saying a lot. To her at least its \"not ugly looking.\" She actually likes the icon and UI look over her Galaxy (which is kind of fixed on Samsung by using Nova Launcher). She definitely likes that it doesn't have a bunch of applications that she has to turn off or hide, and you can actually uninstall ones you don't want. That's pretty crazy in Android world. User menu is so much easier to navigate than on her Samsung. She's not excited about the camera though. If it had the same camera and screen as the GS-6, I think she would \"possibly\" swap for it ;-)I'm not expecting them to update this phone in the future, although I hope that they do. I may even consider using this as a daily driver if that happens. It would be great to see this get future Lollipop updates or get updated to Android M.Overall this is a really great phone, especially for someone on a budget or someone who wants a decent Android phone that isn't going to turn them off of Android like most low in Android phones will, sending you into the arms of an iPhone in a heartbeat. Even if you're not on a budget, this still is a definte keeper. If Alcatel keeps producing phones like this, they'll be giving the high end phone market a run for their money.\n",

      "Got this phone on Friday and I’ve been using it ever since. Things that I like and things that I’ve noticed are somewhat out of place:Pros:• I love the screen. Bright, laminated, vivid. At this price point, it’s truly a steal.• The speakers get surprisingly loud. At first I was worried of the vibrations they created when turned up to about 70%, but I didn’t notice any distortions.• Cameras are pretty good. The focusing is on the slow side, but it usually gets it right on the first try and the exposure works well for where you tap to focus. Camera tip: to access the gallery when using the camera, just swipe left.• Battery life. I consistently get 4 to 4.5 hours of screen on time. Pretty good in my book, especially coming from a Moto X that could get 2 hours max, if I really stretched it.Cons:I will preface this by saying that I believe these are mostly software bugs that can be easily fixed with an over the air update. If anyone else has these issues or knows a fix, please feel free to comment.• For some reason unbeknownst to me, the battery screen does not show predicted battery life. On my Nexus 7, it will show the projected battery life of my device and approximately when it will reach 0% capacity. Along these lines, I also noticed that the lock screen does not show how long until the battery is fully charged.• Double tap to wake, as many others have pointed out, is gimmicky at best. When it works, which is not very often, it’s great.• My mobile connection does not seem as strong as with my Moto X. The Idol 3 shows that I have no signal in many places around my home that would traditionally have at least 2 bars.• Smart Lock with the Trusted Face function does not always work. Most of the time, it is fine. But, 1 in 30 times the camera won’t even be scanning for my face and just says that it can’t find my face. I go to the “improve face matching” in Settings, but it still says that it “couldn’t find my face”. I know the front facing camera is fine because it works when I use the camera app.All in all, I really enjoy this phone and, of course, it can’t be beat for that price! It’s just some of these software issues are somewhat annoying, so hopefully Alcatel/Google will work on some fixes. I honestly believe that these are just bugs in Android 5.0.2 because my Nexus 7 was very sluggish with the 5.0.2 update, but immediately sped up when it received the 5.1. update.\n",

      "I can never seem to settle on a phone. I splurge on the latest new device, only to regret it for some reason or another. Sold my Moto G because the camera was terrible, sold my Note 4 because I think having a $700 phone is ridiculous.Wanted LTE band 12 (T-Mobile is building out their network coverage in rural areas especially with this frequency not supported yet by many phones), a big screen, dual band WiFi, and a price under $300.Initially passed over this phone and Alcatel altogether because it seemed like a very low end brand. This device has changed my opinion of the company. I also looked at the zte zmax and huawei p8 lite, but this Idol 3 seemed to be the best combination of affordability and features.Very customizable and near stock Android lollipop. Great screen, great speakers, decent build quality, decent main camera (seems about as good as my old S4 which was fine), above average front facing camera. Too bad it doesnt have a replaceable battery, but not a huge deal. Doesnt seem like an octa core processor, lagging at times, although not enough to annoy.I usually install custom software on my phones, but after using this phone for a while, turning off double tap to wake, and uninstalling almost all of the preinstalled apps, I like it the way it is.Because it was cheap for a smartphone, I won't be devastated if it gets dropped or cracked. Turn off double tap to wake, uninstall unwanted apps, install a different launcher if you want, install Google keyboard, be careful installing the sim card, dont expect it to behave like a $700 Note 4, and enjoy!\n",

Pretty sure it was the phone because my cheaper back-up phone doesn't have those issues. I eventually decided to return the phone for a refund.

I attempted to exchange but I was only offered a return option. The phone was sent from Alcatel so this is no fault of Amazon.The phone itself did seem to have a bit of a lag to it.

I really had no problems with the double tap feature. It worked every time for me. The screen is very nice for a $250.00 phone. It's very bright and it has very nice color. The speakers are the best feature of the phone. The sound quality of the speakers is very close to my M8. Surprisingly, the headphone jack was rather weak. I didn't try the JBL headphones but my Klipsch headphones were not that loud. My Zenfone 2 has much better headphone output.I would have liked to at least liked to try the phone for a week before giving a review but I couldn't get passed the fact they sent me a used product.

      "Hey guys. I wanted to wait a while to review this phone so as to give better information about how the phone held up after regular use. Sadly, I smashed the screen and had to get a new one.First things first, I am, and have always been an adroid fan. I love how Android works and have only had Android phones. I've had HTCs, LGs, a Motorola, and two Sony's. I came straight from a Samsung S6 Active to this phone in hopes that I could have the same performance that I have grown to love from Android. I must say, I am very satisfied!! This phone has been awesome! I will say that I am not a gamer and can't provide in sight to how the phone performs in that sense. But, I am a heavy user of all the Google apps, multitasking, YouTube, all that good stuff. The phone is awesome. Front facing speakers are very loud and the screen is top notch.I replaced my 5.5 in Idol 3 for the 4.7 after smashing the screen due to the price tag. I will say that I am happy with the 4.7... BUT... If you are looking to have a solid and powerful device I'd recommend paying the extra money for the 5.5. Read the specs on both and you'll see the main differences between the phones. The 4.7 is a steal of a phone. Especially in a pinch of you need a phone quick. I am convinced you will not be disappointed with it. However, the 5.5 version is just that much better. In my opinion, its the real deal and I am happy to have owned it.It's cool to see other companies producing top quality phones with the same specs as the big companies for a fraction of the price.\n",

      "Update 1: I bought my first Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 in June 2015. 6 months later it wouldn't stop shutting down. I sent it in for repair. However, they did not repair it when I got it back. I am not sure the repairman knew what he was doing. Oddly, the repairman shipped it himself to me too.Update 2: Upon writing to Alcatel through Facebook Messenger, they sent me a brand new phone. Had they not done something to make me satisfied, I would have given a scathing review of this phone. $250 might not seem like a lot, but to me it is. And I would have had to buy a new phone with a budget of probably only $50-$100. Alcatel seems like a good company. Though, they now were just bought out by Nokia.Pros:1. Price: I have had looks at my family member's Apple iPhone's and Samsung Galaxy's and they didn't seem much better than this phone in terms of speed or interface. My father's Samsung Galaxy 5 had a similar problem to mine after 1.5 years of owning it. A phone should last longer than two years in my opinion. However, even if I only get a year out of this phone, it is still a better deal than buying an iPhone or Galaxy because they are around $700-$800. So, I would only be spending $500 for two years. But then, you're in Nexus territory and that's probably a better-made phone.2. Camera: It seems really sharp to me. The ability to take HDR videos is a real plus, but the videos take up about 100 MB per minute.3. Charger: The charger is really fast. It charges in about 1-2 hours. The battery lasts for about a day if you use it a lot. If you put it on Airplane mode as I do at night, the battery goes down maybe 1-2%, which is great.4. Headphones: It comes with a pretty good set of ear-buds. They are much better quality than say a Sony pair for $20 or from the classic Apple iPods from the mid-to-late 2000's. Though, I can't say I really use them ever, because I have a good over-the-ear headphone set and a clip-on $15 one for exercising.5. Large Screen: Everyone that has seen the phone was impressed with its screen size and resolution.Cons:1. Android: I believe sometime after getting this phone, Android made it so that apps could only be stored on an SD card. I haven't completely used the 16 GB (which is really around 11 GB) in downloading apps.2. Text Messaging App: This for some reason doesn't have a \"new line\" button. You either have to send multiple text messages or you have to use the voice-to-text feature and say \"New Line.\" All the other apps have a \"new line\" button that appears. It's a really odd gap to leave this out.3. Laggy after Booting or after Prolonged Non-Use: I didn't have this problem in other phones.which were only around $80. But upon rebooting the phone, I have type in my password. However, the keyboard lags in appearing or might not at all if you don't wait long enough for the phone to get its bearings OR the keyboard will appear and it you just won't be able to type on it. This probably happens the majority of the time.This also happens if the phone hasn't been in use for awhile like when I have it in airplane mode at night and then turn it off. This happens probably 1/3 of the time.4. Memo App: Its built-in memo app doesn't have an email function or an option to copy them to an SD card.5. Calendar-to-Map: I put in my addresses for places I need to go to for my appointments. However, if the notification for the even comes up and I click the address, it will open up Google Maps through Chrome instead of just through Maps. It's an extra step that is sort of annoying especially when driving. So, I have to make sure I am ready to go before driving basically.6. Smart Lock: Its trusted places function requires me to have do the same place multiple times if I go to a different level in my house or even a different room.Despite what other reviewers have been saying on here about Alcatel being a horrible company when it comes to customer service, I have found this not to be true so far. Even though they failed to fix my original phone, they got it back to me within a 7-day time frame from the time I sent it in to when I received it.\n",

AMAZING Performance!I started using this phone 6-months ago, so I can give you a valid review over time.Why do I love this phone?- Bright display that I can read in direct sunlight. Brighter than the LGG3, HTC One, iPhone6 and the Samsung Galaxy Note 4- Loud and High quality speakers! JBL stereo front facing speakers and JBL headphones.- Excellent Camera! 13mp camera is by Sony.- \"Reversible Interface\" First phone to offer this feature. The screen orients right-side-up even when you turn the phone upside-down, so the phone is never upside-down- Great battery life; I can Facebook and chat all day on one charge.- Easy to manage and close running applicationsWhat I don't really like about the phone?- Slippery and easy to drop without a case.- Not many cases available.\n",

      "Lots of folks have posted glowing reviews of this phone, so I will simply say that I also love this phone for the same reasons everyone else loves it. It's a fantastic value. But the primary reason I was shopping for a new phone was that my previous phone had an unreliable GPS unit. I couldn't find much commentary on the GPS unit on the Alcatel but there were some hints that it might be better, so I took a chance. I like to use the phone with the Ramblr app to create GPS tracks of hikes. With my previous phone it would take a long time (five minutes was not unusual) to get a satellite fix so I could start the track. And then the phone would give me bad points occasionally, sometimes freezing at a point in the middle of the hike, requiring extensive editing after the hike to correct the trail. I needed a phone with a better GPS unit, and I found it in the Alcatel One Touch Idol 3! The GPS on this phone just works! Satellite fix at the start of the hike takes just a few seconds, and the track continues flawlessly throughout the hike. If you're looking for an Android phone with a reliable GPS unit, this unit should do a fine job for you.\n",

      "Love this phone. Fairly quick page loading, handles as many apps as you want ( currently 40+ and counting). little to no bloatware, good Bluetooth range, and great speakers. Video quality and sound quality is way above average streaming video and music. I can only see two small drawbacks and one may never be a drawback, only a foreseeable one.One is that the battery is not removable. I have had a phone that would not shut off, with the \"Read It to Me\" app running, reading off text messages with the only alternative to remove the battery to stop it.The other difficulty with this phone is it's dual sim, sd card tray. You must use a little tool to get it out. Then you must balance the chips on the tray and slide it in. So if you tremble then inserting the chips would seem to be impossible to me! I lost a sim chip when pulling the tray out and the chip flying off the tray into the trash.All in all, this is hands down the best phone that I have ever owned. I highly recommend this to any android phone user. I also recommend buying a case and screen protector with your purchase. I have read several other reviews that said it is very fragile. But most phones are fragile in my opinion!One other thing to consider is that this phone runs on Android 6.0.1 so if you want the newest operating system (Marshmallow or better) then don't buy this phone. I have not researched it yet but there may be ways to upgrade the o.s. on this phone\n",

      "I came to this phone from using a Nexus 4 for the last two and a half years and my initial impressions were very mixed. Starting with the positive things, I love the LTE, the bigger and more color accurate screen, the battery life, the expandable storage, the dual front facing speakers, and how light it is and how thin it is. All big improvements! I also appreciate the very light touch Alcatel used with their skin on Android. It's almost stock.So many great things and yet it was almost all brought down by an Achilles heel. The thing that really bugged me was that moving in and out of apps was really sluggish and choppy and not smooth at all. All of these things are super smooth on the Nexus 4, which is a 2012 phone. Even swipe typing on Google Keyboard was not great. I came pretty close to sending it back and getting a new Moto G.(I have no proof of this, but my guess is that the phone sends almost all of its processes to the slower of the two chipsets in the Snapdragon 615, the one clocked at 1ghz. Unfortunately there's no \"high performance\" option anywhere that would make everything run on the 1.5ghz chipset. The Nexus 4 proves this is plenty to run Android smoothly.)I didn't want to get a Moto G, especially after seeing (and hearing, seriously those speakers are great) this phone. Thankfully, Android is a pretty flexible OS and I was able to take matters into my own hands and make things more palatable. First thing I did was turn all animations off in the developer options. Second thing I did was I installed Nova launcher and selected the options to make things run \"faster than light.\" Everything is MUCH smoother after doing those two things. Still not quite as smooth as the Nexus 4, but probably 95% of the way there. Close enough where I can deal with it and I can enjoy the good things about the phone that I admittedly skimped on in the first paragraph.So I really like this phone now. It's everything I wanted. It just took some tinkering to get there.\n",

      "I absolutely love this phone. Great performance, UI, very sleek and the dual speakers on the front produce high-quality sound for their size.Most importantly for me and also the reason I recommend this phone to everyone is the outstanding price. Priced at $250 I was able to purchase a 64gb microSD card and a quality case while remaining under my budget of $300. I know some people would prefer the smaller version (4.7\"), and it has an even better pricetag at $180.Some flaws would be lack of mobile service providers (Verizon, Sprint) and the inability to access the photo gallery through the camera app, which has been a standard feature of most phones for quite some time now.For me these drawbacks don't impact the overall score of this phone. I had to switch from Verizon to t-mobile, but have had better coverage and a smaller bill as a result. I could see the camera / gallery issue being a nuisance to some people but to me it's a very minor inconvenience.Overall this phone has much to offer. For music fans it has even more to offer, including a turntables feature built-in to the music player allowing you to crossfade between your songs.Strongly consider the Alcatel OneTouch idol 3 if you're searching for a high quality no-contract phone for an exceptional price.\n",

      "Well, I had this phone for a bit so I guess its time for a review.The good--Looks nice-Feels nice in hand-The audio quality is actually pretty awesome-Screen is pretty goodThe bad--Battery life is average at best-Switching the power/volume button sides from the norm- I thought I would get used to it, after months still not so and it gets annoying-Crashes/locks up at least once a day-The speakers collect a ton of pocket debris-Somewhat slow to charge using any charger including a 2.4a fast charger- ~75% of the time when I answer my phone the speaker phone is active but not showing so in the UI. I have to toggle it on, then off again to get it to normal. SUPER annoying when you hold a phone with speakers this loud to your ear and someone starts talking. I never use speaker phone or a headset so it has nothing to do with anything but the phone.-This is Alcatel's best and they can't give it Gorilla Glass or comparable? This thing is fragile. Mine slipped off the kitchen counter and landed in a bowl of crunchy dog food and shattered. Yes, I had it in a case. The way the screen sticks out a bit seems to make it a magnet for breakage according to me and what looks like a lot of other people.-Price There seems to be a lot of pretty nice what I would call secondary brand Androids coming out lately. Many of them at this price point and some even lower. This phone is probably $50-$75 more than it should be right now.In conclusion-Do your shopping and comparing wisely. I would bet that most of you reading this review are like me, tired of paying $600+ for Samsung or Apple phones that are also locked. While this and no other phones at this price are, or compare to those brands, I enjoy the savings and my new found freedom. This phone doesn't compare to my Note 4, nor did I expect it to. Also, the truth is that I don't really miss my Note. 95% of the features that made the note so awesome got turned off by me anyhow. I don't use NFC, face tracking, eye scrolling etc. I literally never even used the S-pen. What I did use- this phone has, but so do a lot of reasonably prices phones now. I'm not necessarily saying don't buy it, you might love it. Just make sure you know your options and if you choose this- DON'T DROP IT lol.\n",

      "I've had this for about 3 months now. Coming from an HTC 1S. This is an awesome phone once you replace a few apps. The camera app is so so. I switched to Camera 360. Google camera is also decent. Huge difference. The launcher is ok, but I highly recommend switching to Nova free or some other highly reviewed launcher like Action, Go etc.. Another huge difference can be realized by installing DU Battery Saver. Do these three things and you will have a great phone that has incredible audio, very good camera, and superb battery life. I used to go down to about 30% at the end of the day with my HTC and about 35-45% with this phone until I installed DU battery saver. Now I'm at about 50 to as high as 70% at the end of the day. I recommended my daughter install this on her LG G4. She said she already had it and it didn't help much so this may be phone dependent. I'm not a shill for this app just know it works great with this phone. I really like the fact that it doesn't come pre-installed with much bloatware, and the fact that you can uninstall almost all of it if you want. An absolutely great deal at this price. It's not even debatable. Pay $250 and avoid the provider contracts. You won't be disappointed. Also, their customer service is great. T-Mobile accidentally deactivated my ESN and killed my phone.

For T-Mobile customers, the LTE Band 12 (700 MHz) indeed penetrates buildings like only AT&T customers previously enjoyed, when in enable US locations (search for T-Mobile 700 Mhz for more details). The updated radio and being designed for Android version 5 makes this phone more than just a cheaper version of the previous generation's phone, but instead a modern phone albeit a bit easy on the computing horsepower.

      "My TakeHere's my take on this phone. I had an HTC 816 on Virgin Mobile. I was very happy with the phone, but looking to get away from the VM service which was spotty in key locations for me. I sold my HTC as soon as this was announced and switched to Cricket with a Lumia 635 to hold me over until this arrived. I did not like the 635 one bit, and I became increasingly anxious for this phone to be delivered. I watched and read all the reviews to hold me over. I got the phone delivered swapped my sim and was up and running in less than 10 minutes. It was a busy holiday weekend with my family, including lots of driving so I didn't get to play with this as much as I would have liked, but I'm finally getting it fully optimized today. I paid $199 for this phone and feel it was an exceptional value. I love the size and ordered a slim case from China ($4 and delivered less than 2 weeks) to protect the edges without adding significant bulk.Here's here I felt this phone met my expectations-1- Battery life seems great so far, enough for 1 day of moderate usage. It seems to be getting better after each charge.2- Display and sound are as advertised and satisfactory in my opinion.3- Phone doesn't seem laggy with normal app usage and video watching. I'm not a gamer so I can't speak for that.4- Look and feel of phone is excellent. The build quality is nice, and doesn't feel any different from a \"true flagship\" with my slim skin on.Here's a couple minor quirks that I didn't love-1- reversible mode sounded cool in theory, but I disabled as I found it silly based on my own preferences.2- Double tap to wake was a little tricky, and I found my phone had awaken in my pocket a few times and opened up apps. I disabled and went back to using power button.All-in-all, I love this phone and think I will grow to enjoy it more as I get more used to it. I use with Cricket wireless service (on AT&T network) and it seems to work flawlessly. Good luck selecting the right phone for you.\n",

      "my impressions after 3 days:positives:1. great battery life. i would guess 6+ hours screen time easy.2. speakers are absolutely awesome.3. the screen is excellent and very bright. wish we could reduce the brightness (might give longer battery life to boot!).4. no problems with wifi or other things like heat etc.5. user experience is fast enough - better than nexus 4.6. good build quality.negatives:1. camera (ok for the money).2. need unlocked boot loader and root desperately. alcatel needs to realize who their customers are (i.e., what type of people buy their phones!) and provide what they need.biggest negative (unacceptable!):1. tmobile reception is like approx 10dBm lower than nexus 4 overall. where signal is poor, i used to get LTE with nexus 4, but now I can't. IMHO, this is a deal breaker for me. seriously thinking on returning this :(.Added image with both phones side by side. The image is from a place where I have excellent reception. From a place where I have poor reception, the nexus 4 has strength approx -108dBm and holds LTE, but idol 3 is less than -120dBm and cannot hold LTE and reverts to HSPA/UMTS.other:antutu 64bit score is ~33000.\n",

      "I preface this review by noting that (1) I rarely write product reviews, and (2) I only had this phone for a day so far. With these disclaimers out of the way, I'm simply amazed at the quality and features of this device. Coming from an LG Optimus G and a Fire Phone, the Alcatel Idol 3 is miles and miles better than either device - especially the Fire with its gimped UI and other gimmicks.Amongst the standout features are the high-quality screen, front-facing speakers, and its overall compact size. Alcatel has accomplished quite an engineering feat here by squeezing a huge screen and battery into a package barely larger than 4.7 inch phones out there. This device is also incredibly lightweight at around 140g and, just as important, the weight is evenly distributed. Coming from a 4.7 inch screen devices, I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon...As for the software and other features, I'm happy to report it runs an almost flavor of Android 5.0 (Lollipop). The performance is snappy despite featuring a mid-level chipset in the Snapdragon 615; likewise the camera looks good with only the autofocus being a bit slow. It includes a microSD slot so you can add additional memory cards if necessary. I should mention that it takes microSIM-sized cards in case you're switching from a phone that takes a different form factor of SIM. Last but not least, I use T-Mobile as my carrier and have not fallen off the LTE speed band yet (in the DC area).All in all, I think this is a no-brainer for anyone looking for a new Android phone with a large screen. I spent a lot of time researching prior to making this purchase, especially comparing this to the Asus Zenfone 2, and this Idol 3 won out in the end. Aside from the attractive price and features as mentioned, I have to highlight that this phone includes the LTE Band 12. Band 12 is used exclusively by T-Mobile in the U.S. and supposedly allows better indoor penetration and network reception. Something to keep in mind if you're looking to switch to or currently have T-Mobile, since very phones today have this - the Asus Zenfone 2 certainly does not.\n",

      "Beautiful phone at an incredible price point. The display is bright and vibrant; images really pop out at you. The 5.5\" screen makes the phone very easy to use and text is crystal clear. The 1080P screen is simply beautiful. It almost goes edge-to-edge as well - not a lot of wasted space. The octa-core processor makes it extremely responsive, almost instantaneously doing whatever you tell it to do. The rear camera is 13 megapixel, although it is 4:3 at that quality. I leave it on 10MP (16:9) and the photos it takes are magnificent. The stereo speakers on the front, powered by JBL, are really good too. The phone is light, and thin, making it easy to handle and store. TLDR: Amazing phone at an affordable price.\n",

      "For $250, this is as close to $600 flagship you will ever get. The SD615 isn't quite as fast as the 801 in OPO, but it is close and Chrome runs about the same speed. 6hrs screen on and two more hours blasting the speakers before the battery got to 8%. Tmob reception is better than the OPO by 1.5 bars most of the time. The speakers... omg just awesome full deep sound, focus more on the bass but i prefer that. The build, it is so light and thin i forget it is in my pocket. the brushed plastic on the back feels nice to hold, doesn't attract fingerprints. i was afraid the Dragontrail glass would be a fingerprint magnet, but no it isn't. its been a long time since i had a phone with an FM tuner on it... they need to bring this back. even with music freedom on tmob, using the FM radio uses far far less battery than music streaming. oh and the screen... had one guy say, wow that screen looks great, nuff said with the high brightness and deep blacks, looks like an OLED panel tbh.Cons: hard to think of one, side bezels are so thin expect unauthorized tap registers when holding it tight. forget about using it with one hand. so thin and light it does feel rather... like it needs a case.Verdict = if you don't buy flagships, get this phone.\n",

      "UPDATED REVIEW:The phone was repaired, without any problems, and it works perfectly again. The repair center was in Dallas, TX, and they did a good job, in just a few days. The hardest part was filling in the form on their website: getting the IMEI off the phone, getting the proof of purchase, and selecting the proper fields for the issue.This is truly an awesome phone.Now I notice the price has gone down since we bought it, so anybody who wants an Android phone at 5\" or bigger has NO reason to ignore this. At this point, it cannot be beaten for the price (even if, like mine, the networking chip dies and you have to send it off for repair).ORIGINAL REVIEW:I wanted to give 5 stars for this, since it has performed nearly perfectly for the past 2 months. And for the price, this has been the best 5.5\" phone value available anywhere.But sadly, I am worried about the build quality of these phones. Today I woke up, and after 2 months of use, the SIM card is not recognized, and the Wifi is completely dead. The phone has no networking support at all.It seems to be a hardware problem, as I have tried the SIM in another phone and it works fine, and removed SD and SIM, and done factory reset, and the problem is the same. It starts to feel hot on the back, and it will even reboot itself after trying to scan for available Wifi networks when switching the Wifi off and on again.Since Amazon only allows 30 days for returns, I have to figure out how to return it to Alcatel (I hope I can return it after just 2 months). I have another Idol 3 phone, the 4.7\", and it's slightly less than 2 months old. Please wish me luck that this doesn't happen again, and I can get this broken one replaced.\n",

      "This is a very good phone for a reasonable price. I didn't realize the size I was buying (I thought it was the smaller version), so I'm disappointed with the size. Aside from that, the phone performs admirably, and it's recently been updated with Marshmallow (Android v6).I have experienced some quirks with the phone. The screen sometimes shuts off in the middle of inputting my PIN as though the device were inactive. I have to open it again and start entering the PIN again. The Marshmallow update fixed a problem with the Play Music app, which would lock the phone when starting the app. I had to open the phone, swipe, re-enter the PIN, unlock and then I could actually use the app. As you can imagine, this was very annoying, but it's thankfully fixed with Marshmallow. The first problem persists, though it doesn't happen too often.Reception is good. Battery life is good (for my use, anyway). Screen quality and brightness are good. The interface is a bit awkward because of the phone's large size and button placements. It's a little unwieldy to reach the volume buttons and the power button is tougher. Camera quality is reasonable in good light, but overall it's a poor substitute for a decent camera (or even an iPhone, really). Speakers are very good, stereo, and loud.I probably wouldn't buy it again but only because of its large size. If that doesn't bother you, this is a very good buy.\n",

      "I will start off by saying this phone has been excellent and worked flawlessly until recently. I have had the phone for about 4 months now, and it has been inside a case. The power button has stopped functioning correctly. I can still feel mechanical action of the button functioning correctly, but the button is not working electrically possibly due to a broken solder joint. I say this because I get occasional functionality if I press the button to the point that it feels like it will break the phone, and when this works the screen may flash on and off three times as if it was electrically connected three times.Alcatel's support / warranty requires the owner to pay for shipping to and from their facility, leaving the owner without a phone for the duration of shipping+repairs. This level of support for a broken phone under warranty is unacceptable.\n",

      "I have a Cricket Wireless sim card and I was looking for a nice phone to use it in. I have had several Blu phones but they seem to be quirky, never get upgraded to the latest operating system and their customer service is bad.I discovered that this Alcatel was a unlocked smartphone and gave it a try. I was impressed as soon as I opened the box! This phone has a 5.5\" screen, same as my old phone, and felt great in my hands.The reception is great and I usually get an LTE signal out here in the corn fields. The JBL speakers are outstanding! They are placed in the front of the phone, one at the top and the other at the bottom. It is great hearing bass when streaming a movie. The only problem with the speakers is that I can not get them turned down just one more notch. The lowest setting is pretty loud and I have tried all the sound settings in the phone. This is my only pet peeve.The phone updated some Alcatel settings as soon as I turned it on then updated its self to Marshmallow right afterwards. There is very little bloatware which is great. You can add a mini SD card and you have a choice between leaving it as is or you can have the phone include the mini SD card into internal memory. You can have 32gb plus what ever you add with a mini card. I added a 32gb mini SD card so now I have 64gb of internal memory.This phone also has NFC which can be used in many ways. Very few smartphone in this price range have NFC.For the price and features, this Alcatel can not be beat!\n",

Very thin and light to the point that it feels like maybe the battery is missing or that this is a demo/dummy phone with no guts. Very durable though as tested by accident when the kids dropped the phone and it slid across the tiled kitchen floor on its screen and showed no signs of damage without screen protector applied or case on it.

      "First things first, this is not a perfect phone, but it is pretty damn close and factoring the price I got it for $99, this has been one of the better phones I have used recently. So long story short, broke my Nexus 6 and didn’t want to spend a lot of money on a new phone. I tried out a Sony Ultra C5, I didn’t like the screen at all, otherwise nice phone, so I sold it. Then I tried an LG G3 and it was a great phone but the GPS and camera were terrible. Finally I saw this phone on sale for $99 and figured why not?Well it was a great decision. This phone has been updated to Android 6.01 and everything runs well on it for the most part. This is not a fast phone, but it is a fast enough phone. I am able to browser this Internet, play emulators, and watch movies with ease. Again, it isn’t perfect but for $100, or around that price, it is an amazing value!Highlights:- Fast enough CPU/GPU (with occasional freezes/stuttering, but doesn't get too hot)- Expandable storage- Wonderful front facing speakers that can fill a small room with sound- Decent 1080p IPS LCD screen- Near stock android skin- Excellent all day (with moderate usage) battery life- Fantastic 8mp rear facing camera- Great audio quality with headphones- Surprisingly good call quality- Built in music app is fun and useful- NO BLOATWARELowlights:- Front facing camera is only average with poor low light performance- Multi Media messages like group texts, email texts, and photo texts don’t work on stock messaging app- CPU/GPU does stutter occasionally- Phone is a bit ungainly and slippery in hand for one-hand usagePro-tipsTo fix the MMS bug I mentioned about texts under lowlights, use a third party program off the Google Play Store such as Textra. Additionally, I disabled the “enhanced 4G LTE” setting on the phone and that seemed to help.As for the display, it is great for the price, but it tends to run a little on the “cooler” side in terms of color. You can adjust your color hue under settings. I personally bumped it up one on the color warmth and it looks significantly better. Furthermore, the phone display is extremely bright so things may look a little washed out. To fix this, find an area that is well lit (one that represents where you spend most of your day), and then slide the brightness all the way down, then slowly increase it until you find the colors have the right look about them. Personally, I have mine set to about 35-40% brightness. You can always flip the brightness to “auto” when you go into an extremely bright or dark area.\n",

The only thing really lacking is a gyroscope but for the price I can't really complain that it's missing. This is loaded with android 6.0.1, everything seems really snappy. This is the first phone I've used with soft keys and it's not bad. The front facing speakers are surprisingly good. However compared to my last phone the audio stream over blutooth is not as loud, meaning in my car I have to turn the dial up in order to have the same volume.

My service provider is Metro PCS and they were able to activate my phone without any trouble. However I paid a $25 activation fee because I had to purchase a new sim card.

      "I am kicking myself for buying this phone. All I really wanted was a phone to make calls,txt,and use a few apps. Not a heavy user.PROBLEMS started after the 15 day return policy. My reception was poor to say the least. At home my wife's Apple 4 was getting 3 bars and no reception problems. Sometimes I would get 3 bars but mostly \"no service\" or \"emergency only\". So I buy a signal booster for the house...great for my wife, no help for me. Next the pattern swipe for access doesn't work. You end up calling Mexico for help and they want you to go thru \"factory reset\". So I do...3 times. I still have failure of pattern swipe again and the reception hasn't improved. Now they want it back to fix or replace so I'm without a phone while they diddle around with it. If you're thinking about buying this phone....keep thinking!\n",

      "Great phone, first thing I did was update it which took about 20 minutes, it was well worth the wait. There was a lot of lag at first but after the setup everything was smooth. Then I installed my 64 GB SD card and off loaded all the apps I can while setting my camera, voice recorder and music defaults to the SD card ( 16 GBs with only 10 free is pretty low now a days) so with all my apps and cashe totals to about 3.5 gbs combined with 6.5 ish to spare on the phone for apps that can't be off loaded to the SD card.The build reminds me of a better thought out Samsung s4, screen is awesome coming from a flagship HTC m8 and speakers are on par! The plastic build has some defects on the corners, some paint imperfection but you really had to look for it. Peformance wise I didn't noticed much from my HTC m8 I would say I'm not hard core on my mobile devices, just social, YouTube, some games and lot of web browsing. The nice touches of reversibility and double tap to wake are great additions and make a lot of sense ( although I forget its hard to take a picture upside down ). Almost stock android is a delight to use, at first I was so dumbfounded on how much less I had to do to set up the device, which caused me to stare at it and wonder what esle to do.Over all I would give it a 4.5 just because of the small defects in the paint, never the less an awesome phone for the price.\n",

      "I really, really wanted to love this phone. I mean, what more could you ask for?! Super thin and light. Stereo front facing speakers with amazing sound quality. Full HD screen both bright and crisp. Nearly pure version of Android Lollipop. Respectable battery life. JBL headset IN THE BOX. Attractive looks that are just enough different from the crowd for people to ask, \"hey, what kind of phone is THAT?\"Sounds great, right? The problem for me is two-fold. 1) There are only 11 GB of available storage on the phone, which is really, really small. Well, you say, that shouldn't be a problem because it supports Micro SD cards up to 128GB, right? 2) Yes, it does support Micro SD cards but the implementation is almost unusable.You cannot move apps from the phone to the SD card, really. Oh, you have the option in Application Manager to \"Move to SD Card\" but because of the way they've made the filesystem, you only have the ILLUSION of the app actually moving. Move an APP and then go look at the SD Card in File Manager, and you find that NOTHING actually moved.Further, some apps (like Amazon Music) which allow for selecting where files should go, only recognize the SD card SOME of the time. Other times, nada. Also, sometime the SD card wouldn't mount, leaving lots of missed apps and files (even though the apps aren't actually ON the SD Card).Last complaint: Wifi reception and speeds were sketchy compared to all the other devices in my house.In the end, I sent this phone back and bought a used Note 4. I guess $250 is just a little TOO LITTLE to charge for a phone.\n",

      "First let me tell you that I spend a lot of time reading reviews and on tech sites and am usually the guy in the family that everyone asks for tech advice.After my Nexus 5 screen shattered I was not happy with the state of any of the higher end android phones. They were just too expensive and big. SO after much research i settled on the Idol 3 after reading tons of great reviews.DESIGN: The phone is thin and sleek. I quite like the plastic back. It has a nice feel to it. There's not much flair to the phone but I personally like that. Its a little big and maybe a tad uncomfortable to hold because of how thin is it. The front has two front facing speakers, and there's a notification light up front. The tray that holds the sim card also has a place for you to put in a micro sd card.Camera: Right off the bat I have to tell you that the camera BLEW ME AWAY. In auto mode you get some very good images, but the camera comes in full manual mode that lets you adjust ISO, shutter speed, focus, and white balance. I've gotten some AMAZING images from this phone. Its probably the phone's most under appreciated feature. The camera has other modes, but I almost never touch them.Battery: The battery for me on this phone easily last a day, and with light use will last 2. I can't tell you how nice it is not having to worry if i remembered to pack my charger all the time.Screen: The screen is nice and bright, colors nice and sharp. Its not the sharpest, but its a great screen, and better than most in this price range.Software: The phone comes with almost stock android. The minor changes are generally useful, like letting you restart the phone and put it in airplane mode from the power button (which annoyingly google too out of stock android). Alcatel has not been the best about software updates, but they have been really good about security updates. Since i've own the phone there have been two security updates. This is good! Most cheap phones never even see these.Performance: This is really the only place that the phone falters. Games take a while to open, and if you have too many apps or tabs open, the phone really starts to get sluggish. About once a day I end up closing all apps to release some ram. This generally helps, but sometimes I end up having to restart the phone to get it back. That being said most apps are fine. Apps like facebook or twitter don't have any hang ups.Overall, this phone is such a good value. Except for maybe being a tad too big, and sometimes sluggish performance with more graphic intensive games, this phone is a joy to use. In many ways it best phones costing 3 times as much.\n",

      "I've been using this phone for a month with T-Mobile. I haven't had any problems with it. It has a great display, great sound and great connectivity. It fits well in my hand, call quality is excellent. I also use it with Ooma's app to make calls over wifi and that works great too. You'll need to be an Ooma customer to use that. I put a 128GB micro sd card in it, that's pretty well loaded with video and music. It doesn't seem to drag performance. I moved what apps allow it to the card. It's a great phone if you watch a lot of video whether it's streaming or using internal storage. I had considered the Moto G until I found out it didn't support wireless display. I had doubts about Alcatel, but this phone has turned out to be superb. The only thing I don't like about it is the button and usb port placement.\n",

      "Got this to compare with my OnePlus 1 & Asus Zenfone 2 with 4GB. Overall I'm very impressed. Looks wise I'd rate it about equal to the 1 & better than the zenfone 2.Powerwise the Asus & OnePlus both score better than the Idol 3 & yes I to sometimes notice some lag from time to time. The screen & speakers on the Idol 3 are better than both Oneplus 1 way brighter/louder/better than the Zenfone. As the pro reviews have said it isn't easy to see the Zenfone screen in the sun & here in Texas we have a lot of sun. However the Asus is a super game playing device where I'd advise gamers to avoid the Idol 3. It is great with most everyday tasks like e-mail, messaging, phone calls, & web browsing. Camera-wise the OnePlus (esp video) & Asus 1 are a bit better than the Idol 3 but all three, camera-wise are a good bit below the Apple 6 phones or Samsung S6 amoung others, but for their price they're pretty good. Over all I think the OnePlus 1 is slightly better than this Alcatel Idol 3 but the Asus is the best cheap game phone around. Just use a IEM/headphone for games& music with it 'cause the Asus speaker sucks.\n",

      "This is only my own humble review after a week's use after my Sony xperia z3 broke.PROS————Interface is interesting, it has many features, I like the icons and the way the lollipop runs on this phone, screen is big and the colors are good, it runs smooth overall for a 250 dollar phone, I consider it a good substitution for my non-waterproof Sony xperia z3, at a much lower cost, the games run with better performance on this one than in the z3.Sound software is good, and ear buds are much better than the ones that came on my z3, I find it enjoyable to listen to music on my idol 3.It is very light, I haven't dropped it once (which is rare for me) it's design I like more, the camera viewfinder is faster than on the Sony Xperia z3, even though photos are no as good but in relationship to cost/expectation it delivers so much more.CONS————Battery saving modes are nos as good as the xperia's staminas, the battery last a lot although not as I was used to on my older phone. Idol 3 has minor software related bugs (songs stutter every once in a while) volume control is rarely unresponsive and may lag from time to time, sometimes the volume responds but the meter on the screen is unresponsive. Phone may become laggy when more than 5 apps are open, so you have to close them. I haven't found any good cases available for the phone yet, the best one I bought was made out of poor material.Videos don't run as smooth as on my xperia z3.Overall: it is a lot for the price, I can find many pros on this phone over sonys flagship at the time of the review (z3) which costed me more than double the price for this one. It delivers more than expect for money on today's market. So considering that I have to give it a 5 star.\n",

      "Coming from a ZTE Z998, this phone is an enormous upgrade, but does have its quirks. There are many features of the phone that are simply great, but I'll cut the chase and get to the dirt:*Phone is a little laggy at time, especially in Google Chrome.*Double tap to Wake rarely works on time. Sometimes takes up from 1 to 3 minutes for the phone to finally come to the lock screen.*Cellular service signal often just quits. Not sure why, but it is kind of annoying.*LTE signal takes quite a while to lock in. Most of the time the signal comes in with H+. This does effect down/upload speeds.*I've found Bluetooth in my car to be a little quirky. Phone doesn't always sync automatically with my car's Bluetooth. Not sure why?*When getting a phone call with a 3.5 mm jack plugged in and Bluetooth also enabled, call goes through or comes in, but parties on the phone can't hear one another. I've looked into the settings, there may be an issue here?Aside from those issues above, which can likely be worked out if Alcatel ever issues an OTA update, the phone is great. Videos and music are crisp and clear. Games are fun to play, very little lag there. The screen is great! For a phone, the audio is fantastic! You can move your apps over to the SD card to save internal memory. Not all the app data is transferable, but being able to move it over does help. I wish there was a way to control where your \"downloads\" save file to, but unfortunately there is not and a download automatically saves to the phone's memory. You have to make a conscious effort to move the file over to the SD card, as to not consume your internal memory. 11 GB's of memory doesn't go too far these days.For the money at $250, this phone is a pretty good buy and worth the money. It is clear however where Alcatel cut some corners to stay in the $250 price range and still make profit. Too bad phones are so throw away after 2 years of use. Guess that's the nature of technology and people always wanting something better. Enjoy the phone!Screen protector and a phone case are a must if you want to preserve any phone for at least 2 years. There aren't too many phone case options for this phone yet thought. :-(\n",

      "My 1st impression upon opening the box was \"wow, this is gorgeous\". Yes the back is plastic, but the build quality, color, finish and overall design makes it look and feel like a premium product. I was pleasantly surprised at how sturdy yet lightweight it was when I first picked it up. Turning it on made me feel even more wowed. The screen is just gorgeous, probably the best that I've seen. It's sharp, hi-res, great colors, and the GUI and near stock Android experience makes the experience that much better (unlike Samsung or other phones where they have great screens but the GUI ruins the premium feel).There's some lag when I'm going from app to app, but I'd say it is something I can live with, it doesn't happen all the time and closing all the apps seems to remedy this problem. I'm able to play the latest games, and for the most part it's a fast experience.I was worried about the camera from all the reviews and 100% cropped sample images I saw on the web. But actually after several test shots I'm surprised that the photos turned out well. The photos are a little smudgy when zoomed 100%, and low light performance could be better, but when I'm viewing them on FB or just zoomed out on my pc, the photos are very clear, good contrast and decent colors. The quality reminds me of an entry to mid-level point and shoot camera, or an iPhone 4s or 5. I wouldn't zoom in all the way or print these photos that's for sure, but the camera is actually better than what all the reviews online have made it seem (it's a 250 dollar phone for crying out loud).Overall this phone is a steal at 250 bucks. I'm thinking of buying 1 for both my parents. I would not hesitate to buy this at all, and the best part, it's an affordable phone that doesn't look like an iPhone.\n",

      "I spent three weeks comparing phone specs on gsmarena and I'm very impressed by this phone. It stands up well against the so called \"flagship\" phones. For those looking at $100 phones, my advice would be to save your money and wait until you can buy the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 which is very reasonably priced for what it brings to the table. This phone is a very lightly skinned pure Android phone, which Alcatel did such a great job with I no longer need a launcher such as Nova. Over the air updates are also a major plus. The build quality is fantastic. This phone has a metal center body wrapped top and bottom with aluminum or stainless steel bands -- I can't tell which. The top band also wraps over the stereo speakers. The back is textured plastic, which is a must because it wont interfere with the internal antennas. I also like the slide out sim and SD card tray and the full 1080P display. Those things, and much more, are what you would normally pay $1K if you bought a \"flagship\" phone. One word of advice, leave the display brightness on \"auto\" or you'll use too much battery. Other than that, battery life is fantastic no matter how much you use this phone during the day. Alcatel would sell a lot more phones if they'd list more technical features for their phones, and I'm not really sure why they don't. I could write a lot more, but let's suffice to say, I am not easy to please but I am very happy with this phone. Normally I would find something I don't like, but in this case, that didn't happen.\n",

      "A lot of people have suggested that a power user should really go for one of the top tier flagship phones where they don't compromise on CPU, RAM, display etc. I am a software developer and most definitely a power user. I take a lot of time to customize my phone and I use it very heavily and I can say without a doubt, I will never spend $500 on a phone again now that I have seen what $250 can buy.If you know how to manage your memory, this phone is very snappy. I haven't done much in the way of 3D gaming so I can't comment on that but that's not a power user thing. That's a teenager nerd boy thing. If you want a mobile gaming platform for your spoiled brat, you may want to spend more. I for one couldn't imagine spending $600 or more on a phone that will probably get broken in your kids backpack, but that's your call.The display is quite nice, clear, bright colors. The camera is even quite good. The battery could be better but it still lasts me a full day with heavy use. I'm not a big fan of the stock user interface but now that I've loaded Apex Launcher, that's been resolved anyways. There are a ton of launcher options out there and they all offer a better than stock user experience in my opinion. I highly recommend Nova, Apex or Hola Launcher but there are a bunch out there worth exploring. I'm happy with Apex but I like to explore and see what else is possible.Still, if all of that was good but the call quality was bad, this wouldn't not be a positive rating. That was a major concern for me since there are some ratings out there that knock the call quality. I really don't understand professional reviewers on sites like C-Net or PC Mag that give a glowing review of the phone when the one negative is the poor call quality. It's a smartPHONE. The PHONE part should be the most important. Anyways, while it's not the best call quality I've had, it's actually quite good. The only complaint I have about call quality is that I sound a little tin to the user on the other end of the call. They can still hear me clearly, even in a noisy environment and there's no reverb or echo or scratchiness. The sound quality on my end is quite good also, including the speakerphone. Also, I get a better (cell radio) signal with this phone than I did with my T-Mobile HTC One or my unlocked Sony Z3 which means I can make calls in places where I couldn't with those phones and I have less likelihood of having a call dropped.For this price point, it's a fantastic phone. I used to only buy flagship phones for between $500 and $700 and I always felt ripped off (Sony, Samsung, HTC). This is the first phone purchase I've made in the last 7 years that I feel like I got my money's worth (and then some).Bottom line, if you are in the market for a flagship phone, consider what you will actually be using it for. Then consider saving yourself some money.\n",

Phone is running fast and not lagging even when using multiple apps. Speakers are super loud. So far I love this phone. Update. After a month of having this phone I have to say I love it. It is everything I want in a smart phone. Great screen. Super bright. Very thin. Awesome battery life. Good speed opening and switching between apps. Love the loud decent sounding front facing stereo speakers. Love being able to use phone in any orientation.

Problem was that this phone saves the last IP address of each WiFi. This is sub optimal, because the router isn't using fixed addresses. Win7, Win8, Linux, other Android, and Fire platforms all handled this with no problem.The manual and support site are not useful.

The only problems I see that are major issues are the reception and text message issues. Reception on this phone is extremely spotty. I have my galaxy S5 next to it - sometimes the idol will be on emergency calls only while the S5 has one bar of 4G LTE. The text messages will come in out of order sometimes. Also, group texts revert to a 1970 date and fall to the very bottom of the text queue.

      "The positive 5-star reviews are accurate, and overall this is a great quality phone for the price. Everything works well.However, after having used it for some months, then trying out an HTC m7 with a 4.7 inch screen, I wish I had gone with the 4.8inch version of the Alcatel oneTouch Idol. While readability and viewing videos from a distance is nice, the 5.5\" screen is too clumsy, too difficult to hold in one hand, and too long to fit in a pocket. It just scares me. I live in fear that it will grow too big for me to safely control anymore, and one day it will take over my life.It is also incredibly slippery without a case. More points off for handle-ability. I think they grease the backside with Crisco. This, combined with the clumsy size, makes it super easy to slip out of your hand.Even with the case (I bought here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ZOER95Q?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage) it is difficult to keep in one place.

      "It's been about a year since I've had this phone and I would buy it again if the new version wasn't out. For those interested in this phone it is under $100 here on Amazon. I find that a great price for a beginner smart phone or for a person who isn't interested in all the bells and whistles of a $700 phone. This thing gets the job done for me running on Android 6.0.1. Ok now for the reason why I gave it 4/5 stars. The phone battery gets warm to the touch under heavy use like watching videos which causes it to kind of feel sluggish. The camera is weak under low light conditions but that didn't bother me since I rarely used the camera. Video quality is alright in clear conditions but like the camera I had no use for that feature. Finally battery life is not that great if you find yourself away from an outlet. Good thing it charges fast. I could go into other features but it really is just a phone for me to keep in touch with family and work. One final thing. The up front dual speakers make listening to music fun. No more cupping the speaker to redirect the sound!\n",

This turns the display on and causes the battery to drain quickly.When the battery fully drains the phone doesn't turn on even at full charge, it has to be overcharged for another hour before it turns on. Had to charge mine 10 hours last time battery complete drained before it would turn back on.The person who said this review is not helpful was probably a shill working for this crap company.\n",

      "I am very disappointed with this purchase. I have been using the phone for less than 2 weeks and I am very close to flushing it down the toilet! Within a few days of using it, i noticed it started freezing for hours on end and only a battery pull can resolve that temporarily.... Please note that I have only ever downloaded one app and that's whatsapp. About the 5th day of using the phone, I noticed that it began shutting down on its own, sometimes it restarts, most times it doesn't. Another issue is that the wifi keeps turning off on its own or just jumping off the internet. Also, the mobile data also spontaneously turns off by itself. Yes, that's 4 issues in just about 12 days of owning this phone. It has now become the bane of my existence! I am so frustrated with this phone, they don't even deserve 1/16th of a star! I will never purchase this phone ever again and I wouldn't want it even if I was being gifted one! I will also warn everyone I know not to purchase this phone, for the statisfaction they will receive from the reasonable price will surely be negated shortly thereafter with the range of issues that this phone has. I guess I will just have to dig deeper and purchase a more reliable phone that will undoubtedly cost me 4 times than what I paid for this, I felt like I wasted my $200. I am certain of one thing, an Alcatel phone will never be brought into my home again! People be warned.... Don't waste your energy, money or time, just save until you can get a better phone, one with warranty and some accountability on the company's part and most importantly never purchase a phone over Amazon. I am totally dissatisfied with the entire purchase as I also never received the Mr. shield screen protector and when I contacted them they told me to contact Amazon! I should have known this was a raw deal and returned everything! Alas, this will never ever happen again. Worst purchase ever!\n",

I decided to give it a test drive. This phone isn't very powerful . I am going to give a review on what's important to me. 1. Signal. It's allover the place fading in from full bars to no bars of LTE . I discovered if I put it in hspa it's fairly stable . In areas that have a great LTE Signal It's fantastic. 2. Call quality. It's middle of the road not great , not horrible. The moto g4 plus is way better , but the g4 has VOLTE . The idol 3 doesnt.3, battery , it's a little better than okay . If I don't use it , it will last . If I do use it it is just like every other phone .4. Responsiveness. I have a galaxy s7 edge . I am used to touchwiz lag . This phone lags as much as my Samsung . I did change the settings in developer options. 5. Screen ..not bad its fairly bright. 6. Storage it's been updated to 6.1,1. It now has adaptive storage . Buy a good SD card if you are going to use it as adaptive storage.7. Size for 5.5 it feels pretty small and very light. I put a glass screen protector on and my favorite slim case. It feels and looks pretty nice.8. Emails and text they work well. I think if t-mobile didn't force Alcatel to disable band 12 (or if Alcatel paid for band 12 license this review would be better. All in all if you can grab it for 99$ do it. But for more go with the honor 5x or moto g4 . For some reason I like this phone .its over a year old now and still a decent performer .\n",

      "I have never owned a smartphone because I am always near a computer or a family member with a smartphone. On a recent trip, I was amazed at how useful their phones were during our travel (Uber, Lyfte, AirBNB, Airline information, Maps) and decided I would get ready for my contract renewal in a few months, by getting a cheap smartphone and loading it up, via WIFI connection at home. Read the reviews and this one was priced at $99. Why not? It's been a week, and it has been eye-opening. It's replacing my clip on MP3 player, cause it plays MP4s as well. The sound is incredible. I have a 64 GB microSD with all my music, that I hot swap into the phone's dual slide. The slide has space for a microSD and a SIM card. I enjoy the built-in radio, Skyping, and using Viber on my WIFI. I've got apps to read Word and Excel documents, my G-mail updates...it goes on and on. It does take around 20 seconds to boot to a visible screen once you press the on button, and I think that may fool many into thinking the phone isn't working, as they repeating hit the on/off button. Just push on, and have patience. The OS also rebooted several times over the first few days, but after a week, that has finally stopped. Camera takes good pictures but not great. It's been fun, and I haven't even activated my phone yet. Once I do, and probably with Cricket, which uses AT&T towers, everything should be ready and I won't have a learning curve.\n",

      "I felt like I should write a review on this as a \"average\" phone user.I am a tech guy and have worked in IT for over 15 years, but I don't have to have the best of the new phones. I use mine for mail constantly, browsing 10 or so times a day, usually just to look something up quickly at home. Facebook at night a few times maybe, every once in a while games, but usually just basic stuff like Spades or backgammon, every once in awhile some \"better\" game. Maybe 50 texts a month on average.On to the phone, keep in mind I am coming from a Razr MI ordered 2 of these to replace to Razr M's on Verizon and we were switching over to Cricket wireless so perfect time for this phone to release.Setup - super easy, Turned on the phone, picked my language, setup my wireless connection, and it let me know there was a 50+mb update. Took like 3 seconds to download it and then it installed and rebooted,It then prompted me to setup or transfer my account, I figured hey transfer it, it told me to put my old phone back to back and seconds later my account had transferred over.The screen is huge compared to what I am used to, and very bright, I have it on auto-adjust but it's usually around 20% brightness, it is so bright.I don't use my phone while walking to text or do Facebook etc. but I have checked notifications outside, no problems reading in sunlight. Colors look fine to me, at least for what I need.Audio is pretty loud, the dual stereo speakers are more than what I would expect out of my phone.If I want to share a YouTube video with someone we both have no problems hearing it play.Web browsing, I have had no real problems or lag as some others seem to have had, but I do limit what I browse to on my phone, I don't go to some of the sites that have tons of ads etc. on my phone. I have no problems with slickdeals or dealnews like some people have mentioned.Wi-Fi speed is awesome on mine, I am on 5G in my house and it's so much faster than my old phone or my laptops. It's actually just as fast as my main rig on a wired connection. Every test I have run is over 55mb down and 6mb up and I am on a 50/5 plan. For me it's very fast as tested by Ookla on multiple servers.Data speed, I don't use much as I am on wireless at home and at work, but I have had 4gLTE everywhere I have checked it and I am in Northern Idaho which doesn't have near the same coverage as say Seattle.I haven't had any problems with any apps installing or crashing.Actually I have several apps that seem to work a lot better.Fitbit, and Yamaha AV Controller for example work so much better and quickerBluetooth is great, synced to my car easier than my last 2 phones did, has extra security on \"trusted\" devices for both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices.Supports USB and Wi-Fi tethering, both of which I will probably never use.I have a 64gb SD card in mine and the limited access I have used it for has been fine.Reversible mode works and is neat to show people, but I like most people will usually pick up my phone the right way, but it makes handing your phone to someone else easier if you want to show them something.Tap to wake - this is discussed a lot, works fine every time for sleep, but it does seem like some app installs make it wonky. If I go back into gestures and turn it off and then turn it back on it seems to fix the problem.Not all apps break it, but I have had it happen twice now.I don't have a problem with the power button on the left, fine by me, better than on the top like some phones.Included apps don't bother me at all, and lollipop seems to run fine on my phone.Some people have had problems etc. but anyone who has been around tech knows, all companies, all products, ship bad batches.Phone is very light but I am getting used to it already, I have it in a case which has made it not seem so fragile anymore.Overall I really like the phone and for $200 pre-ordered I am more than happy. Plus I used turbo-tax this year so bonus Amazon gift-cards paid for mine.As for the camera, I haven't used it yet, I take pictures on family outings etc. but haven't had the chance yet.Plus if I know I am going somewhere I will want to take pictures ahead of time I am going to take my DSLR.I honestly don't care what the camera is like on my phone to be honest, but the little I have seen will be fine for my needs.I paid more for each of my lenses on my DSLR then I did for this phone, so what do I expect right?There are some other things I could talk about, but that is the gist of what I am going to use the phone for.Update:7:00 a.m. 5/28 took it off the charger - 10:18 p.m. 5/29 44% left on the battery after 2 days of use, several phone calls and 6 trips in the car synced to the car.Also should note you can go into the specifics of the battery and view Wi-Fi and network strength as well as screen-on time for the entire time broken down by the hour since last charged.At this rate I could make it almost 2 more days before running out of battery.Also should note I have the notification LED off and the notification tone set to only go off once when something comes in.Update 6/3 I took my wife's off the charger 5/28 and she has used it mildly since then. She has been home a few of the days, but still uses it everyday a little. As of 9:00 last night phone was at 50%. Pretty dang good. Keep in mind my old Razr M had to be charged halfway through the day at this point due to shortened battery life. So being able to go for days is so nice. I went 4 days on my last charge as well. But I didn't make it to 6 like the wife did.Still enjoying the phone, I still cannot believe how much better all my apps work on the new phone compared to on KitKat.Update 7/13 For those that were asking 52 days, just got upgraded to 5.0.2 today on the firmware. So they are updating pretty well since it's product launch time hasn't even been 2 months and they already have 2 updates plus dealing with all the BS from a product launch so overall I would say pretty good.Still love the phone, I would say the battery life is a little shorter than I first thought but I think it's because it works so well I find myself using it a lot more than I used to use my old phone.Still a great value for the money for me.\n",

      "Overall this phone is a good value for money. I personally believe most of the current very \"few\" issues are due to buggy lollipop not the hardware of this phone. Battery life and Screen can beat the crap out of any phone on market. I dont think its a sluggish phone by any sense. A little hiccup here and there is okay for a normal user.

      "Out of the box, the phone already had problems. During setup the phone developed a serious error that could only be resolved by doing a factory reset. I used the phone for 4 days after doing the factory reset, pretty happy with its performance. But then this morning I went to turn it on for the first time - black screen. Tried holding down the power button for several seconds, nothing. Tried doing a factory reset, nothing. Since the battery is not removable, there's nothing to be done now except send it back. It's really too bad that I waited 5 weeks for this phone to come out and in the first week it already turned out to be a piece of junk. Super disappointed.\n",

      "A very solid phone for the asking price.I was able to purchase this device during promotion for 199 dollar, but in this review i will compare to the Mate 2, Note 4 and Nexus 4, iphone5, which at the time of my purchase was 300 dollar, 750 dollar, 360 dollar and 600 dollar. I'd like to mention that the asus zenfone 2 is a very capable phone and priced at 199/299, but i do not have a unit to compare with.pro1. build quality is superb. the phone is assembled with high precision, the unit is very thin and very solid. the entire phone has no creaking when pressed and each button has very nice tactile feel. it is very similar to the feeling of Nexus 4, which was also superb in term of build quality and overall finishing.2. the speaker is superb. it is up there with HTC boomsound and i think it might actually better at bass (HTC may be better at treble). at any rate. the speaker is miles apart from anything else and even better than most tables (that includes ipad). the true stereo speaker and high definition sound (for a phone) really helps when you watch video or play game without headphones or boombox. and most importantly, this phone's speaker are very well placed and it hides within the frames. so all the glory without HTC's huge ugly speaker grills.3. screen is awesome. it has one of the brightest screen on a phone. no issue to use in the day light and it is capable of display vivid images at a extreme wide angle. it easily rivals the screen found on iphone 5. in the realm of IPS, this screen is as good as it goes. (but i still prefer the ALMOED on Note 4 better for its deep contrast).4. stock andriod. pretty much the vanilla andriod with very little touch to add alcatel's reversible screen. which means very little overhead and smooth operation.5. support SD card. while most say SD card is useless, i would not purchase a device without capability of expanding storage. i often travel for business and leisure. and many place i go does not have cellphone reception or in an country that cell data is very slow. I always keep the Here map and its offline data in my phone in case i need direction, and that's a good 15 to 20G of data all by itself. and if one uses the phone to take photo or video, he/she will use few gig of storage in a week or two. bottom line, after 9 month of using Note 4, i have already exhausted the 64G SD card and just moved to 200G SD card. and having SD card on a phone, even if you don't think you need it, is a big plus to me.average1. camera is very average for 2015 flagship phone (but very good for 2013 standard). the only other phone i have at the time of the photo comparison is Note 4, which was released in 2014 but has one of the very best camera in smart phone at the time of this review. compared with Note 4, the onetouch idol lacks resolution, white balancing and image sharpness in pretty much any lighting condition. However, i would say that Idol3 does perform very well compared to the flagship phone from two generations ago (e.g. iphone5, Galaxy S4). do bear in mind that this phone does not have a sticking out camera housing like the latest smart phones, and this phone is VERY thin (7.4 mm compared with iphone 5's 7.6 mm). it's optics will suffer even with a capable CMOS sensor.2. performance. again, this phone would have no problem when compared with flagship phones from two generations ago (like HTC M7, S4 or iPhone 5) and might even be slightly faster. which is to say that phone is perfectly capable for daily tasks such as reading email, browsing web or play games (even the very intensive games like implosion). you would probably see occasion lag when scrolling through a huge PDF file or some complicated websites, or a longer loading time for games, but not a deal breaker in my mind. it is not until you doing transcoding or running benchmarks will you see the huge difference between current gen flagship and this phone, but who dose transcoding in the phone anyways?3. reception. in the same location, this phone's reported reception is always about 11 to 15 dbm lower than the Note 4. which would technically translate to 20% of signal strength (since the highest is probably -60 dbm if you standing right next to the tower and lowest usable cell phone strength is around -125).4. compromises: with such wonderful design and display, there are sacrifices has to be made for this release price. for one thing: you don't have 802.11 ac, you don't have Magnetometer or a Gyroscope, all of which zenfone 2 has for similar and cheaper MSRP (199). while i do miss the magnetometer and gyroscope for fast location and direction. i do not miss the 802.11 ac feature. the ac allows you to transfer files at a much greater speed (about twice as fast compared to n in my test with computers), but this is completely useless because the phone's internal storage is so slow that it doesn't matter how fast you can pull down the data. at least on my Note 4, the transfer rate doesn't seem to have any difference when running ac or n.4. processor: i am not against weak processors and i have said this processor does do it job. BUT the 615 is just gimmicky. technically with its octa core, it should be little-big design that you have two cluster of computing units, one is fast but power hungry (A57/A15) while another (A53/A7) is slow but power efficient. but in this device, you have 8 A53 core, just one cluster is clocked faster. REALLY??? qualcomm has no reason to not just release it with standard 4core A53s and add a speed governor to achieve the same effect. in fact, qualcomm said themselves that 615 was released due to market demand for more cores not due to power efficiency or performance. i'd much rather see a 801 or intel's core in this phone than 615 for the similar price.overall, a very solid phone that actually have a good design. it is one of those product that doesn't do all the justice just by reading the spec sheet. you have to see it in person and feel it in hand to appreciate its craftsmanship and balanced performance. while not perfect, it does have a lot of merit for its price tag even at 250 USD.

      "I decided to put down my big name flagship for a bit, and was pleasantly surprised.This device boasts a bright (even on low) large screen, decent processor, Android Lollipop, front facing speakers, good battery life, and LTE band 12 that I need on T-Mobile. And that whole package comes in at an insanely low price.It's not as fast as my Oneplus One's 801 processor, but overall I'll take front facing speakers and better LTE over minimal processor speed gains. It is an octacore 64 bit, so it's no snail, it can compete with any big name device. IMHO the speed races are over, and software/hardware optimization is key, which Alcatel did a great job.Oh and this brings JBL headphones, it's rare that any OEM puts accessories with devices now, some don't even include chargers.Software wise, it's very much Vanilla like. The screen rotates no matter which way you turn it, it adjusts to you. Also, you can double tap to wake AND to sleep. It's the simple things that I love. And since it's running on Snapdragon, you won't have compatibility issues (Intel) or slow downs (Mediatek).Ultimately I was too used to my Oneplus customizations so the OPO called back to me. But if I didn't have my old flagship killer, this would be my phone. I'm recommending this device to everyone!*UPDATE*I had the device in a case, and screen protector. It suffered its first drop, from hands, and the screen shattered. Be VERY CAREFUL.Also, I plan on getting a tempered glass protector once I get it back.In case I run into any issues on RMA I'm paying for, I'll update.*UPDATE 2Really expensive repair service. $39.99 triage fee charged whether you get it repaired or not, if you don't pay it you don't get your phone back.+$54 for a screen replacementI'm done with Alcatel\n",

      "I caught this during their pre-release. At the time I was thinking about replacing my cracked screen Note 2. My phone was still functional, but it has been a couple years. Since the Note 5 should be released soon, I purchased this inexpensive phone in the interim. I wasn't expecting so much, other than it to hold me over.Pulling it out of the packaging, immediately, it felt slim and light. Almost light to the point of cheapness. That feeling has gone away since, now I appreciate how slick and light weight it is.I fired it up, the screen looks beautiful. Bright, with great color too. Turned it back off, inserted my sim card and sd card. That was a bit cumbersome compared to previous phones that I have had, but given the slim nature of the design, it may have been a necessity. After getting it all setup, and navigating around a bit, I found it pretty snappy. I downloaded my normal apps, and installed Aviate, the launcher which I have been using since beta and find very clean.If you're coming from 4.x Android or another OS, you won't have the small gripes that I have. I had installed Cyanogenmod 12.1 on my note 2 before switching to this phone and there are quite a few features I miss from that version. These are minor, and in no way have a significant negative affect on how I like this phone. The fact you can use the phone, or any app upside down is a neat idea, but in practice, your buttons are in the wrong spot, and it still feels upside down. The camera seems good, but I am no camera expert, and only take pictures from time to time.Over the past week or so, here is what I found that stands out:Good:Front facing speakersScreen quality, bright and detailedLight weight*** PRICE *** I doubt you'll find anything close in this price range, rivals $500+ phones imoBattery lifeCall quality via hand set, speaker phone and bluetoothNot so good:Not a lot of case optionsOther notes that may affect your purchase decision:Charging port position is off center, awkward, and may interfere with some cradlesPower button feels like it is in the wrong spotNon-removable battery, may be no issue, I haven't ever replaced a battery in my other phones, and I expect one to last at least a couple years which is fine to me.Bottom line for me:I was surprised how good this phone is. Initially it was supposed to be temporary, but I will keep it until I break it. Good phone, crazy awesome price! Unless you want the specific name brand, buy this, you won't be sorry.6/3/15Updated observations:When in a phone call, the screen doesn't rotate, even when just using bluetooth. This causes a small issue when I want to go from a phone call to using navigation software since I want the landscape view. As soon as the call hangs up, it rotates how it should.I had one random reset, of course this was while I was navigating downtown Seattle and needed to know my next turn.I took the time to watch video on this, and the audio is AWESOME!Battery life is definitely acceptable for me, not the best or worst. It lasts me more than all day though with moderate use.There is a feature that can be turned on that allows you to tap twice to turn on/off the screen, that does not work so well.7/7/15Ended up with a very small scratch on the screen, probably from my keys, so if you pick this up, get a screen protector.Still overall a five star purchase to me!\n",

This phone is exactly the same software and hardware as $400+ phones the memory/RAM may just be better!2. Because it isnt a flagship there isnt any \"forced\" signing into your personal email, google or other accounts. Pop a sim card in and you're good to go!Now to the phone itself, the video display is amazing so crisp and clear. I tend to have my phone in the lowest brightness setting all the time to preserve battery life and the video is still amazing.The pictures and videos the phone take are to cool, I love the time lapse that saves as a video file. My wife has the same phone and loves using Snapchat with it, even though there is no front flash.I like playing games on mine and the size of this thing makes it so easy, because the ram is so good there is no lag/freezing.

      "It is big, which works well with my big hands. It's cheap, it's responsive and had a great looking screen. It can finally be rooted, so I'm keeping an eye out on development for this phone. I've dropped it plenty of times and the screen hasn't cracked. Maybe that has to do with the LK TPU case I have on it. The software and timely updates have made the phone better. Good camera and speakers. It has band 12 for Tmobile LTE. Unlocked for any carrier.My issues with it are the button placement for power and volume. The power button should have been placed halfway down the phone instead of right across from the volume buttons. I often trigger a screenshot when i just wanted to turn the screen off. As time goes on I am getting used to the placement and I make those errors less often. Also, the double tap to sleep/wake up is not always responsive. I try a few times, and then I end up having to push the power button to wake up the phone (which is what I would have done anyway if there was no tap to sleep feature). Overall very happy with this phone.\n",

      "This phone is really nice for the money. The front facing speakers and the dragontail screen are what originally sold me on the phone, as these features are really hard to find on phones with higher price tags. The screen is so smooth and very responsive. The weight and balance is just right, so you feel like you got something for your money. Yes, there is some bloatware but, there are some good apps to remove what you don't want. The JBL headphones that come with this phone are a nice added bonus. Packaging is very nice also. Alcatel really hit the mark with this one. Let's just hope they keep up. The only bad which may not be bad for everyone, is the reversal of the on/off and volume buttons. I would fire the engineer that threw that in the suggestion box. Overall I really like this phone and wouldn't trade mine for an iphone or samsung...\n",

It's essentially a cheaper version of the Galaxy series (I own one, so I can compare). Yes, you lose some of the features-- the camera isnt as good, etc-- but for less than half the price as the Galaxy S6 or iPhone 6, the value is beyond comparison.The dual speakers are amazing and super loud, even at only half volume. Very clear. Awesome reversible UI so that you can have the phone in any orientation and use it, even for calls (look up a video for this). Runs Android Lollipop, so it's basically top tier. Battery life lasts me all day with very very heavy gaming use, and a few days with light to moderate use.

      "I like my phone for reasons that have already been stated more eloquently by others, so my review is going going to focus more on turning some of the dislikes I have read into likes:1.) Double Tap to Wake is not on by default. You need to enable it in the settings.2.) Double Tap to Wake is not 100% compatible with 3rd party launchers. It loses about 50% of its functionality on a 3rd party launcher IIRC. Personally, I was coming from the Google Now Launcher. (ProTip: I missed having the Google Now cards show when I swiped to the left of the home screen. One old work-around that I forgot existed is that I can just swipe up from the Home screen button (The 'O' button). Quick way to launch Google Now Launcher without making it the standard launcher or going to the app tray.) With that said, even on the Alcatel OneTouch Launcher, Double Tap to Wake is not 100% efficient. It is especially finicky when you try to use the feature to wake a phone that has entered deep sleep mode. However, if pushing the power button with your finger is a deal breaker, then that is some serious #FirstWorldProblems. I have no issues doing that one handed and my hands have never been big enough to palm a basketball.3.) Delete the (small amount of) bloatware to eliminate any unnecessary apps running in the background. This can assist in speeding up your phone if you are having issues. For example, I read that the AVG Anti-virus app specifically can cause a lot of lag on the phone since it is running in the background 24/7. Never had a need for Anti-virus scanner on Android yet so it was the first thing I trashed.4.) Personally I have been pleasantly surprised by the camera. Granted my previous phone had a mediocre camera, but still. One thing I've started doing that I've never done before is to tap the screen to focus the camera prior to taking pictures. This has been an Android feature for a while, but I just started using it and I really like how my photos are coming out, even at night. Alternatively, over at the Idol 3 XDA Forums, there are suggestions on other Camera apps to download, as well as manual settings to get the most out of your pictures if you are unhappy with the default options.5.) Try a factory reset if you are experiencing any issues after an OTA update. I think this is more to do with Lollipop than Alcatel because my other Android devices also were a little buggy after OTA updates to Lollipop until I completed a factory reset.If those suggestions do not address your concerns, Alcatel has confirmed via an email response to some XDA members that they are working on releasing another OTA update after reviewing feedback from the community.At the end of the day, many professional tech sites have stated that this is the budget phone of 2015 with good reason. Even if you think that professional reviewers are biased, here on Amazon, the current numbers as of 6/6/15 show 80% of Idol 3 reviewers gave the phone 4 stars or better. At the time of writing, the Amazon reviews of the OPO is 80% as well while the ZenFone 2 has 78% of reviews garnering 4 stars or better.\n",

      "So I am usually not rushing to write reviews, however, it doesn't take very much time to conclude that it is a somewhat mediocre device and falls terribly and disappointingly short of satisfaction. Consider this rating a scale from 1-3 stars and I'll explain why. Depending on what you are looking for in a cell phone, the rating will go up or down. At least this is what I have seen in other reviews. I'll cut to the chase:PRO1. SPEAKERS/JBL Sound system is AMAZING. To the point that music played on this thing out plays my lap top speakers! Believe it or not. You are carrying a mini boombox. Alcatel gets 5 star is this area. They can be too loud nonetheless so please be careful and considerate or you are going to sound like that person in a relatively nice SUV with a so so speaker system that rattles.5. Look is okay. My friend thought it was an I phone or something more expensive/high end. The phone is super light.2. Screen resolution is okay. Not 4k but c'mon it's HD. I am sorry to hear reviews from people that have received defect units.CON:3. THE DOUBLE TAP FUNCTION IS ALMOST NON-EXISTENT. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS AN ALCATEL OR SOFTWARE PROBLEM. Most likely something to do with the device. All of these 4 and 5 stars received excellent/polished devices with no problems, which I find really hard to believe. This is annoying. You will just have to use the power button to turn on and off.6. SIM CARD DID NOT READ APPLICATIONS I HAD BEFORE AND OVERALL PHONE INTERFACE CAN TAKE TIME TO TAKE USE TO.6.5 I don't think Screen is scratch resistant.7. PHONE CAN BE SLUGGISH WHICH IS ANNOYING!!!. I WAS NOT EXPECTING THIS FROM A $250 DOLLAR PHONE. I HAVE AN OLD LG F6 Metro PCS phone and with all honesty, I don't know which is slower or faster at times. Some applications stopped working all together and I had to uninstall and install again. WTF<---!!! Really.*Caveat. My employer subsidized 50% of the cost which meant I only paid $125 out of pocket for this cell phone. BUT I am trying my best to be objective here and I can also say that I would not have paid $250 for this phone.which brings me to item number 8.8. coverage with AT&T drops randomly!!!!!!!. I DON\"T CARE HOW MANY #1 or #2 STAR REVIEWS THIS PHONE HAS ON AMAZON. THIS along with the laggyness of the phone dropped this review from a solid 3 to a 2 star. A ONE STAR DOESN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN MY BOOK OF REVIEWING. I was hesitant in rating this a 2 or 3 star but this made it clear. I am not crying about having 4gLTE 10000% percent of the time but when you can't hear someone because your bars just drop when other phones don't drop signal *in a good area with good reception (this statement compares other cell phones in the house) Just doesn't make sense.*second caveat. I don't pay for monthly service or service at all. BUT STILL, I WOULD NOT WANT TO PAY FOR SERVICE JUST TO HAVE A GOOD LOOKING TOY PHONE WITH GOOD SPEAKERS. NOPE. SORRY.This would be a better choice if the presale price of $200 stayed or if it was less because this is what this phone is worth. IN MY OPINION!!!9. CHIPSET and ram are a bit below mid range in terms of specs. Nothing great to be honest especially when we are entering the age of 3 and 4 Ram cell phones with Snapdragon chipsets in the 800 range and Melta kits etc.10. Battery life, at least in my case has not been impressive. I don't know if it's my device or what. But I have been using this phone not to slightly and not to heavy and it appears that the battery drains rather quickly compared to most of the reviews here and online that are boasting about this phones battery life.11.5 Phone gets warm to the point of hot near the camera when in use. Not even using for hours. Just using. This is alarming. Not sure if this is normal but again not cool.12. I don't know yet if I want to hassle and buy another phone and send this back, get my money, etc. Even though Amazon seems to do well with returns.13. I wonder if anyone else has this similar dilemma? Did anyone return it, get their money back and bought another Alcatel or something else?14. I hope my review helped someone out there. Go ahead and buy it, but please read some of the other reviews. Seems like some of us got a bad batch? Maybe. Go try your luck. this could have easily been a 3 or solid 4 star. I don't know about a 5 star. I am being honest but I am also picky. I did a lot of homework before getting here and even then I had some doubts. Guess you never know till you have one in your hands.

      "I love this phone. I previously had a Galaxy Nexus on T-Mobile that was getting very long in tooth. If you have a phone on T-Mobile that doesn't have LTE, like Nexus 4, just get this phone already. Lots of areas down I-95 in North and South Carolina that don't have HSPA signals, only Edge or LTE. It was annoying my wife. She would be fuming about her slow connection on her Nexus 4, and I'm running a solid LTE signal.The only thing this doesn't have that the Nexus lines have is the wireless charging. This one has NFC for mobile payments or easily connecting Bluetooth devices, plus the addition of the microSD card slot, radio, good stereo speakers (although not the loudest), and a truly all day battery. This is a great value as well for $249.It's a big phone. I have large hands and find it hard to use one-handed. In return you get a huge screen that works well in bright Florida sun. It is surprisingly light though.One thing, without a case, I have large hands but my fingers would frequently touch the screen and cause the phone to do things unintentionally. I got one of the LK Ultra Jelly Series TPU Gel Rubber in clear frosted plastic, and it takes care of that problem. I would have gotten the manufacturers case, but it had sold out.\n",

      "So far I really like it considering the price. I switched from a Galaxy S4. My main love is the pure android feel of the device. SO much better than Samsung's touchwiz. Night and day improvement. Size is large, yet it doesn't seems abnormally large in my pocket. Slim and sleek. Good screen quality. Headphones are nice and a bonus. Mine work fine. Some said theirs don't work? Speakers in phone are great. Battery good. Reception and call quality seem good so far for me. I do seem to have one less bar than my s4 but haven't had connection issues.Cons: Doesn't appear to have a remote controller to control the TV. I liked that about the S4. I'll have to just get over that, but became used to that feature. Camera is ok. Seems about on par with the S4 which wasn't iphone quality but pretty decent unless indoors. Faster focus though. No home button. Instead just double tap the screen. Kind of like that, but it's taking some getting used to. Frequently the double tap lags or doesn't register to wake up device. Kind of annoying. Volume on the right also taking some getting used to. As with all unlocked devices, other than iPhone you can't get WiFi calling and texting on T-Mobile. Hope android fixes that soon.Overall I'd say I'm pleasantly surprised. It's much more enjoyable to use than the S4. I just got it last night so these are my quick observations. I can update more as I use it. The interface on this thing is amazing. More like an iPhone in pleasure and ease to use. Icons are live unlike the S4. Bye touchwiz! For $250 I can't imagine a better option.Update: I'm bumping this up to 5 stars because the more I use this the more I really like it. Was at 4 stars prior. Had some issues with my alarm clock not going off. I think I've fixed the issue now... hopefully. Called tech support today and they answered right away and helped me out. Kudos to Alcatel. Only major annoyance now is that I have to hit the power button to wake up the phone. I'm getting used to it, but not quite as convenient as a home button. The double tap only works 50% of the time so I've given up on it. Overall the interface on this phone is just a pleasure to use.\n",

      "Phone looks good, sounds good, and is even good to hold in the hand but has a tremendous amount of lag, takes too much time for apps to install, and most importantly, the signal reception on this device is TERRIBLE!!! I am constantly without service on this device. As soon as I pop out the sim and insert it into my G2 or Note 4, boom, I have full 4G LTE (I'm on AT&T). Double tap to wake almost never works. The unorthodox button placement is a PIA to get used to.I can understand the lag issue, with this being a budge device but come on Alcatel. This is 2015, phones shouldn't have reception problems these days (there's a reason we don't see the \"can you hear me now\" commercials...)\n",

      "I am fortunate to have only paid $100 for this phone back in September. Now the price is much higher but still well worth it.My other phone is a Motorola G3, third generation, the one that is somewhat waterproof, a unique quality of that phone. I have gone back and forth with these two phones and love both of them, but I always come back to the Alcatel. Since I am a musician I value one quality of this phone that very few phone orders give a hoot about, and that's the sound. The sound produced by the speakers of this phone is truly amazing considering that it is just a cell phone. My Moto G sounds tinny by comparison and my wife has a Moto X Pure and even hers can't begin to compare with the sound of the Alcatel. I also love the unique screen size, 4.7 inches, a nice, small size that is easy to manage and has excellent quality as well.The camera is every bit as capable as the Moto G and overall this phone is a most excellent phone, especially for the price. I would highly recommend this phone, and likely even some cheaper Alcatel phones based on the quality of this one.\n",

      "Minus the negative reviews I thought i'd give my opinions to crack down on the phone if you want a basic 16gb phone this is not really that bad it loads youtube really well and the camera feels like it tracks your height. Minus a white UI or User Interface for noobs all you have to do is install a launcher I'd prefer the Samsung S6 style because it turns the UI 100% transparent for my first phone I am satisfied. There's only one flaw is the guide book strictly tells you not to use it so much to retain its full performance speed and the battery might over heat any way so it's recommended to NOT constantly keep it on.Don't be confused because I told you the battery heats because any battery in a phone can over heat and catch fire, Sadly phones are not build with micro cooling fans which can cool down the device unless you get a phone case that supports a built in cooling fan. I would recommend a grip case though because the phone is slick. Also watch out because the phone screen its self is actually glass which is possibly fragile but has a good quality display that I really like and YES it is HD!If you get this phone make sure you also get a screen protector and I'd recommend a stylist if you're worried about smudge marks it also prevents others from seeing your pin code or drag lock code. The phone also fits with the Homido VR Head Display and can support virtual reality because it has a gyroscope and 360 tracking. I really love watching anime with it and can't wait to get it activated the only issue I had was it did not load youtube repeater that well so any way to end this I will say it's pretty good for a standard phone but if you want more performance go with a 32gb phone or above but for 16gb this phone is worth it and for the price.\n",

      "There are an awful lot of Androids out there, plus other phones built on differing operating platforms . . . but this one is a standout.With the use of a SIM card you need not be tied to an expensiv 'minutes you'll never use' monthly plan. I spend $25 every 3 months on a AT+T GoPhone account - SIM only - but don't burn data on it . . . I use wifi signals whether I am at home or traveling. In 3 years I have saved $1,800!I've had the phone less than a week, and these are my observations thus far . . .THE GOOD+ Dual-band (2.4GHz / 5GHz) for wifi . . . Netflix is SNAPPY on the 5ghz band of my home router. Downloading huge maps for offline use is also ZIPPY. Disable your data function!+ Adjustable screen brightness+ The cost. I would have liked to have paid less, who wouldn't!, but this phone is a long term investment, and money well spent. If you're on one of the 'big boys' data plans, then the Idol is couch change to you.+ The camera: 13 mp front, and 8 mp rear. Nice quality, and being a photographer I know what I'm talking about. Low light? I saw one review stating that the camera function was poor in low light. Pffft!+ Video: 1080p high def. Gorgeous.+ Accessories: The screen protector, holster and the gel-like skin were all $10 each or less from Amazon.+ Display: 5.5\" is plenty big enough for reading, playing or watching movies.+ Audio: Seriously, the JBL speakers couldn't be better.+ Storage: 16gb, plus if you need it you can add a MicroSD card up to 128gb in size.+ As it's an unlocked GSM phone with a SIM, it can be used globally by purchasing a local SIM when you arrive. I've been doing that for years with my old Android.THE BAD [not really]- Power switch is on the side not the top, so I often adjust the side-mounted volume controls by accident- You can't switch to a fresh battery if need be, but that said I never used the back-up battery with my previous phone.Talking of my previous phone, it was a Chinese Android knock-off - the Star V1277 - so in comparison you're probably thinking that I'm easy to please.You're right, but so will you be if you purchase this phone!\n",

      "I bought this phone after having used an iPhone 5 for 2.5 years. I'm no phone expert but I have owned several smart phones including the original Samsung Galaxy, and iPhone 3, and the aforementioned iPhone5. The reason I chose this phone was the specs and the decent price. I paid 250 with a 10% discount from Amazon which reduced it to 225. For an unlocked phone that performs decently that is a good deal. My thoughts about the phone below.The good stuff: The phone itself feels solid. I like the front facing speakers - they provide good sound. The screen is good. It's bright and big and does what it's supposed to do. The back of the phone doesn't feel like plastic, although it probably is. The fact that I still can't tell three weeks into it should tell you all you need to know about that. The size of the phone was a bit daunting when I started using it (iPhone 5 is tiny compared to this phone) but it's grown on me. I can finally read comfortably using a phone. That means I use my tablet less. Finding apps is not a problem. Google apps seem to work just a little bit better on Android, although that shouldn't be a surprise. My wi-fi connectivity works great, and the phone calls I make sound clearer than my old iPhone. The 4G/LTE connectivity seems to work better too although I can't prove it.The bad: The phone is noticeably slow when starting apps. The wait time to start apps is measured in seconds and it's annoying. If you buy this phone, buy the one with 4GB RAM. One nice feature that really helps me is being able to shut down all open applications with one button click something the iPhone never had. Another bad thing are the button locations. The power button and the volume buttons are on opposite sides of the phone at the same level so when I push the button to shut off the screen I end up squeezing both sides of the phone which takes a screen shot. I can't even tell you how many screen shots I've mistakenly taken. Not a huge deal, but again, annoying. I don't particularly like where Android puts all it's system settings, but that's a personal nit since I'm still acclimating to the Android.Bottom line: It's a good unlocked phone at an affordable price. I'd recommend it with the caveats I mentioned.\n",

      "Screen died on me 1 week after purchasing. The screen suddenly started to display stripes and the colors are completely off. Phone was generally good but I did experience the gentle lag that all the reviews refer to. Not a deal-breaker, but noticeable. The issue with the screen did however prompt me to return the phone because I don't have a lot of confidence this phone will hold up based on the sudden change of the screen quality. I've been trying the mid-range, well rated phones of late and had no luck with this one as well as the Asus Zenfone2, so I guess I'll have to continuing searching or suck it up and just get an unlocked iPhone if I want something a little more relaible. I want to love this phone, it's almost there, the headphones are really good, the screen was great before it crapped out, but I just don't want to putz around troubleshooting something I just bought. Better luck next time I hope...\n",

      "I am a tech junkie, and this is one of the best cell phones I've ever used. The screen is beautiful, the look and feel is very premium, the speakers are the best I've heard on any mobile device, and the software is the perfect blend of stock Android and some very useful customizations (the feature that flips the screen orientation is really cool). Seriously, the speaker is outstanding - music sounds incredible and I now love to use the speakerphone. The ONLY complaints I have about it are that it is sometimes a TAD bit slower than the flagship phones in opening a program or doing a task, and the camera sometimes has grainy images in low light or when you zoom in. But even then, I compared it with other phones, and I'd say the pictures are only 5%-10% more noisy than the best ones, so it's not a big deal. Plus the shutter speed is really fast. And I like that the LED flash is a more yellow color which leads to more natural toned pictures taken with the flash.The button placement, as people have mentioned, is a little weird, but it is not a big deal and you get used to it quickly.\n",

      "Wow-wee I love this Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 phone! I've had it for week now and it does everything I want.The phone, Billy, showed up within 24 hours of being ordered - one of the perks of Amazon Prime. It arrived in great condition.I use Billy on a T-Mobile pay-as-you go plan and the T-Mobile store was able to transfer my contacts over from my old Blackberry phone. They were also able to cut down my large size SIM card to fit the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 small SIM card format. They also fit in my old 8GB memory card without trouble. They said the passcode had to be turned off to transfer the contacts and this phone does not allow the passcode to be turned off, but they were able to transfer everything over OK.To make full use of the features of this phone I had to create a free Google account, which was no big deal. It is not required to use the phone, but it makes it easier to use the built in Google apps.The text messaging interface works nicely and seems to be adapting to my style and word choice. It suggests the next word and is getting better and better and predicting what I am trying to say which makes texting faster.The camera takes amazing pictures with crystal clarity. I'm really impressed with the quality of pictures it takes. Speaking of clarity, I've watched a couple of YouTube videos on it and I was blown away. The resolution and crispness of the colors is better than my television and the sound it fantastic.I also got a FitBit and I really enjoy monitoring my progress on this phone.The battery lasts me throughout the day although the battery is low by the end on the day. My old Blackberry would last for 3 days before it needed a charge, although I would charge it every night. But to be fair, with all the increased features on this phone, I'm using Billy a lot more. It is also much bigger than my old phone. I used to wear my old phone on a holster on my belt, but that doesn't seem practical with a phone of this size. It generally fits in my deeper trouser pockets OK.Overall a great phone and I really love it.\n",

      "This is an awesome device for the price. Feels good in hand. Great display even in sunlight. Loud audio. Really cool software features. Pretty fast. Noticed a little stutter when downloading a web page with multiple embedded mixed media. Did not try any games on it. Double tap sleep was great. Double tap wake worked <50% of the time. Minimal bloatware. A pleasure to use!The problem: Using this on T-mobile, I could not get a good enough signal in my house to make or receive calls and texts. Figured that it wasn't a carrier issue since my kids (in same house with same carrier) had no issues with cell reception on their Moto X (2013) and Samsung Galaxy S5. It wasn't a SIM card issue, I put it in my 9.7 inch Chinese phone tablet that wasn't meant to be used in the U.S. and I was able to get a strong, consistent 3G signal and make calls from it with good clarity. My phone seemed locked to finding an LTE signal, and instead of dropping to 3G or 2G connections, it would simply not connect at all. Through 95% of the house I would get No signal or Emergency calls only mode. If I changed settings to 3G only or 2G only I could sometimes get a good signal for a while, but then it would suddenly disappear even when the phone isn't moved (sitting on the table). I lost signal completely at a local Subway, at my doctor's office, and had a call cutoff a couple times while sitting at a mall parking lot. I need my kids to be able to reach me at all times in case of emergency.Signal strength on this phone throughout my house would be about -125dBm and 99 asu while on LTE or no signal at all. I got a Samsung Galaxy S4 on sale for $299 and was able to connect consistently throughout the house. It's LTE signal strength was about -115 dBm and 35 asu, so the Idol 3 was about -10 dBm worse and hence no calls. Right now the S4 switched down to HSPA with -105 dBm and 4 asu. The Idol 3 would never switch down, just lose connection. Not sure if that is a problem with my specific phone or a general software issue. The Galaxy S4 can also make wifi calls, so I kept the S4 and returned the Idol 3.I had great connectivity on the Idol 3 at work and in an adjacent city, so if you live in an area with good coverage and won't venture out of the area much, then this phone may work great for you.While sorting through this issue, Alcatel was very responsive to my emails, so +1 to the seller. I hope their next phone has a better antenna and is wifi-enabled for calls, because I really liked this device. I really wanted it to work for me, but bottom line, the best phone for me is one that can keep a connection with my carrier in my area so that I can make and receive calls and texts. A phone that can't make calls is useless to me.For those of you who have great reception, you've got a good device at a great price!\n",

      "So much for the joys of unlocked phones. Regardless whether I let Android automatically detect network or I manually choose any of the 3 discovered MetroPcs networks, I receive error the \"SIM Card Not Permitted to Connect\" to network. Went to YouTube and created a few custom APNs to no avail. Alcatel .pdf says all you need to do is plop in the SIM, your micro flash and let Android do the rest. 250 dollar brick at the moment. Returned the SIM back to the old phone and all is well. Not the experience I expected, having read the Alcatel guide online.**Update: Replacement phone has no Chinese-language error messages. That was first hint that initial phone had some unusual problem. Amazon returns are very easy and as soon as box was in UPS queue the refund was issued (same day). Metro would not associate phone ID with network without purchase of a new $26 dollar SIM card from the store. I would think an active SIM from previous device associated with new device should work, but I would be mistaken. That's how they roll, apparently. Their rationale is that stolen phones on their network are their bane and this procedure makes their lives easier by associating one phone per card--whatever. How nice for them. Folks at company-owned store were polite and efficient about it, though. Phone, itself, is pretty good. If the \"Recent Apps\" screen had no esoteric animation, there would be no performance lags to report. Launching and switching between apps is quick. Great media device. Handles everything I throw at it with ease. While the Sony hardware is so-so, it looks like the preloaded software isn't the best, either. Swap out the installed Camera app with after-market one and the reported camera deficiencies are improved, even in lower light. For $250 bucks it's hard to beat for average use. Cell phone connoisseurs will never like this phone so ignore the hate.\n",

      "Summary:Just an amazing phone for any price range.I have been using my Idol 3 for about 4 days now and I must say I am loving everything about it. People all over the net keep talking about just how great the screen and speakers are. I can't stress this enough they are both truly amazing. I am coming from the OnePlus One and although on paper the OPO has slightly better specs all around. I think that Alcatel did a much better job of implementing android more so then CM did. I stress this because basic functionality just operates so much smoother. For example typing. Typing just about anywhere whether it be writing an email or texting or whatever, is just extremely responsive. After having used my OPO for almost a year I had gotten used to having to type a little slow. On the IDOL 3 I can speed type again which means I can get more work emails done faster this I love! I don't see to many people talk about this fact but the screen is very responsive as well as it is bright. This is also my first phone with front facing speakers. All I can say is wow what a difference that makes. I watch a lot of videos on my phone and it does really enhance the experience all around. The phone itself is actually smaller than the OPO as well as it is thinner. It feels very sturdy and portable I put a screen protector and case on my and it is still very pocketable. Also a lot of people are asking about updates. Well I too am a little concerned about updates. However right out of the box I received one OTA update of around 50mb which I installed right away. Every now and then you see a little lag if you are a heavy multi tasker like I am. But I feel confident that this is related to crappy lollipop 5.0.2 and that once this guy gets the latest 5.1.1 those issues should be all smoothed out as 5.1.1 is know to perform quite a bit better and isnt supposed to have the memory leaks found in 5.0.1. My only other is the double tap to wake. This feature works here and there and isnt very reliable. I am sure they could fix this in a software update.\n",

      "It's a great phone and an awesome value. Was stepping up from a Nexus 4. It's pretty close to stock Android with some minor tweaks to the UI - which I didn't mind. Battery life was pretty good (I could go a couple days with medium usage). The screen is crisp and bright. Sounds were loud and clear. And that brings me to a minor issue I had with the ringer and notification volumes: At the lowest level they were a bit too loud. Call quality and data speeds were great. I did experience occasional sluggishness when opening and switching between apps. As I used it for a couple of days, I struggled to get used to the power button on the left and the volume rocker on the right (it's completely opposite of the Nexus 4). This, combined with the larger size made it awkward to turn on/off and adjust volumes. I thought I would enjoy a larger device with the 5.5\" screen, but I just couldn't get used to it. Perhaps, if I kept using it, I would eventually get used to it. But why compromise? I'd rather buy a device and love it from the get go. Welcome back Nexus 4! For me, I think the 4.7\" screen is the perfect size. I still recommend this phone.\n",

I use it for reading and the size is just right.+great screen and brightness+decent battery+speakers are excellent+included JBL earphones are very good+premium finish+very thin bezel all around.-Slippery in my hands, needs a case for sure-there's an ever so slight delay, not bothersome, but it's a tad slow if you are coming from a snapdragon 801/805 processor.\n",

      "I have gone through a Samsung Galaxy S5 , an IPhone 6 plus , an Lg G2 and now landed on this ALCATEL ONE TOUCH IDOL 3 phone all within the last 8 months , having used high end devices , I did not have too high of expectations from the Idol 3 as it only cost $199 at the pre order special price . I have been playing with it for the last two days and below are my impressions .Pros : the biggest one is how much device you are getting for your money , this phone has a large 5.5 inch 1080p display , JBL tuned front firing stereo speakers that sound great , a 3000maH battery , heck it even comes with rather nice JBL earbuds in a nice package , these are specs you will find on devices that cost much more from other well known brands . the build quality is just fine , the phone feels nice in the hands , the software is well done with Android Lollipop running almost stock with very little customization done from Alcatel and not much bloatware. the display has rather accurate colors and looks sharp just like any other flagship device , the 13 Mp main camera is not the best in the business but pictures look sharp in well lit places and okay for low light ones . the front facing camera is just okay as well . you can perform almost all tasks on this phone without any slowness for the most part (see cons ) and this is where I should get in to the cons .Cons: so what is the catch , I mean there has to be one for a device that costs less then half the amount of a flagship device from other Major brands , well for one thing the Octa Core Qualcom 615 processor used in this phone might sound mighty on paper but the fact is that it is an outdated processor by today's standards , although it performs most tasks just fine , you will find stutter and slowness while browsing the web in the browser and in some apps , it is also not the best device for gaming . the battery specs also look great on paper but so far I have been rather underwhelmed by it with Lg G2 outlasting this phones battery by hours , I hope that the battery will get better with a few more charge cycles . overall all though it is a fantastic device for very little money , if you watch youtube , movies or listen to lots of music on your phone then you will love the front facing speakers , just do not expect this device to be as fast as the $700 phones out today and you will be just fine .\n",

      "Love the phone for the price. Changing the standard icons seems a little silly and it definitely runs hot, but I am happy with it overall.Update: My son thought my phone needed water so RIP Idol 3. Had bring your own device family plan insurance through AT&T(needed it on phone purchased via Next). The claim with Asurion was a HOT mess. This phone was not on their \"list\" of devices and they really don't have any infrastructure for a non flagship phone. Their replacement of like quality was an LG G Flex 2. They charged a tier 3($200) deductible and had no way to appeal that decision. Seriously, 71% deductible. AT&T and Asurion played hot potato about the $200 deductible and I ended up filing Dept of Insurance and FTC complaints.So, long story short either assume the risk and don't get insurance on this phone or insure it via anyone but Asurion. SquareTrade has a $75 flat deductible, repair instead of replace options, and costs less than AT&T/Asurion too\n",

Front camera is OKThis phone's sound quality for media (music apps/ YouTube etc) is the best one I have used and it beats my note 4. It uses jbl stereo speakers which produces amazing sound. You will not need your Bluetooth speaks for park or BBQ.Gaming is not that good and there is a little lag for heavy duty apps.This phone is better than lg g3, nexus 5, galaxy s5 or HTC m8 and other last year's flagship models.If camera is not the priority, I use this over one plus one. It is better than moto g and previous moto x.It's not going to compete with s6 note 4 or nexus 6 or m9.Microsd slot is a plus for some but removable battery and lack of quick charge is a minus for many. IDC about removable battery.Given the price I paid ($200), I am a satisfied customer and would recommend anyone who plans to buy a budget smartphone.

      "Throughout my lifetime, the prices on consumer electronics have dropped steadily as capability and quality rises. Smartphones have been an exception, largely because of the subsidy model, and something that acts as a good quality tablet but with data connection and the ability to make phone calls could easily run you close to $800. That puts this Alcatel Onetouch clearly in the budget category, despite being more expensive than a tablet or moderate sized television.These days many carriers are moving away from the subsidy model, and those who are looking for less expensive phones were stuck with ones that were far less capable. Alcatel has changed that with this phone. While it won't compete with the latest high end models on today's market, it has power and capability that even high end phones lacked even a few years ago. This \"unlocked\" phone is technically a non-locked phone. It's not loaded with a slew of apps from a specific provider and even lets you get rid of some default apps that you may not want. An important thing for any device not tied to any specific carrier is compatibility. This phone covers all the bands needed for carriers such as AT&T or T-Mobile or any other that uses a SIM, and that includes 4G and LTE bands.It gives you 16GB of memory, with about 10GB available for user content. It also supports a microSD card, for up to 128GB more. It takes a micro SIM, which is fairly standard these days. It gives you a fast Octa-Core Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 processor, which I found responsive. I haven't tested it with video games that are extremely CPU or graphically intensive, but for typical tasks there should be no lag. You get very good sound for built in speakers, and the phone works just as well when you flip it over, even for phone calls.The cameras are very good resolution for an inexpensive phone, and are better than what even high end ones had a few years ago. But you don't get any special frills or controls for exposure. You get a good 13MP camera and an 8MP front facing camera, both of which beat what you find on other inexpensive phones, and both can rival cameras on better phones for outdoor daylight photos. For low light situations, you will get adequate pictures but not at the level of high end devices. You also get 1080p video. One of the big advantages of the video button is that it starts taking video and stops taking video. On other cameras, it will switch you to video mode, but why? All that accomplishes is letting you share the shutter button, which offers little value and is especially awkward if you want to take landscape videos. With this phone, the video button is in a logical place for landscape video, there's no reason to switch modes, and your shutter button still works for still photos. That way you can take video much faster without waiting to switch modes, and the button will work for those holdouts who still insist on vertical videos.I haven't torture tested it, but the glass is supposed to be highly scratch resistant and more breakage resistant than for typical phones. The phone itself doesn't have the look or feel of a cheap phone. Phone screens have been growing larger, and this one gives you a 5.5 inch screen. Personally I could make do with a smaller screen, but companies make phones with smaller screens that sacrifice capability in many other ways and Alcatel is no exception.A few things I don't like about the phone are that the battery isn't removable. That might not be a long term problem since battery life is pretty good. I also don't like the offset USB connector on the bottom since it makes it awkward to use the built in cradle in my car. This is a disadvantage compared to what works well for companies such as Samsung or Apple. The other thing that's apparently missing is WiFi calling for T-Mobile. Google now has a Hangouts dialer, which can accomplish the same thing and aside from caller ID not pointing to your primary number that could be a workaround.Other issues have to do with support. The phone has been out long enough now that the company should have phone-specific support information on its website, but it's still not there. This phone doesn't show up on the list on the support page. That means there are no downloads or phone specific FAQs. The phone comes with a Quick Start Guide, but no user manual and there's none on the website.UPDATE: There is still no link to a user manual on their website, but customer service was able to send me a URL for one. There are some features that need further explanation and I was hoping that the user manual would cover them. For example, the status LED doesn't work like the one on other phones or have colors to indicate anything. The phone has a setting to turn it on or off. You'd expect the manual to tell you what the LED indicates, but all the manual says about that setting is \"Touch to turn on/off the LED indicator.\" If you want to know how the time lapse feature for the camera works, the manual says \"Touch to enable Time-lapse\" when describing the setting, but that's already obvious.Overall, you get a lot for your money. It may not be the highest end phone out there, but the big companies better look over their shoulders. It beats what they offer at this price point and I wouldn't be surprised if this company has something that is truly competitive with the competition's top of the line in the near future.\n",

Great display (almost rivals the $389 OnePlus 2, which is my daily driver)3. Loud speakers (louder than the Galaxy S6, the LG G4, and the OnePlus 2, but not as loud as the HTC One M9, the Moto X Pure Edition, and the Nexus 6P)4. Nice battery life (better than the Galaxy S6, but not as good as the Nexus 6P)5. Clean UI (uninstallable bloatware, stock Android-like interface)Cons1. Average performance (1.5GHz octa-core S615, 2GB RAM is not as good as the Asus Zenfone 2 and the OnePlus X)2. Average rear-facing camera (colors are dull, focus is slow)3. Charging speed (2 and 1/10 hours)4. Bloatware (even though it can be uninstalled, it'd be nice if it just didn't come with it)5. Not durable enough (doesn't feel robust and dependable)6. Price (it needs to be $200)So, it's an overall okay phone for the price, but I would go with the Zenfone 2 or the OnePlus X.

After 5 months of use I can say definitely say that this phone is a huge disappointment.The Idol 3 has a nice big 1080p display which looks great, 2 GB of RAM, a decent processor, slim sleek design, and a mostly bloat-free stock Android OS. Unfortunately, the software is horribly unoptimized because this phone suffers from lots of performance issues. Lag when watching videos on YouTube, blurry pictures with the camera, and apps taking ages to open up are some examples.I had my phone bricked when trying to take a system update so I set up a warranty repair on their website and overnighted my phone to Alcatel. Only to have it returned to me 3 days later unrepaired because my phone had \"water damage\". My phone has been in a case since day 1 and has never been submerged in or splashed with water. Clearly they don't want to honor their warranty.Pair that with the fact that this phone rarely gets patches and will likely never be updated to Android 6.0 and I recommend paying a little more for a Galaxy, LG, or Nexus phone.\n",

      "I'm an IT professional, although I'm also a single dad of 3. So price is the main thing here. This is the best phone... For the price I could get. I love it! Camera is great. Compared to me friends LG V10. I have almost all the hardware for less than half the price. The speakers are the best Ive ever heard on a phone in the mid or flagship range. No overly loud but stereo quality is excellent. The LCD display is amazing for what it is. No 4k was not a deal breaker for me 1080p is more than enough. I've dropped it at least 20 times and there is not even a scratch. EvoCel case. With TMobile the quality is off the charts compared to my old S4 and Lumia 640. If your on a budget you cant get much more for the price!\n",

      "I really, really wanted to like this phone. The screen is just fantastic and the speakers are amazing. It absolutely blows away my Moto X 2014 in that regard. The processor is OK, there's a bit of lag here and there but it's not overwhelming and something you can easily live with. The battery life seemed to be really fantastic, and it was a mostly great device.I only ran into problems when it comes to using it as a phone. Calls sound muddy, and everyone who I spoke to had issues understanding me. Coming from my Moto X, which had fantastic call quality, this was very disappointing. Using the phone in speakerphone mode didn't help at all, if anything, it made it worse! I've also noticed it struggled with signal strength in the same areas where the X had no issue, consistently pulling a signal that was anywhere between 5-7 dBm worse than the X.Maybe I got a bad device, but in reading more reviews I've noticed that muffled calls and signal issues seem to be commonplace. Honestly, a slightly better microphone and antenna would make this a killer phone. If your goal is to use the browser and apps, you'll be fine with this phone. If you plan on anything more than occasional call, I'd look for something else.\n",

      "I purchased this phone a few weeks ago but wanted to wait until Alcatels update before I posted a review. Pre update this phone was 4 stars tops. Post update it's a 5. You may have noticed other reviews knock the double tap feature. That's been completely fixed. The camera is better and lag is nearly non existent.Pros1) the front speakers are as good as advertised - I've tested them with my HTC m8 and they are easily on par with boomsound (without the infamous bezel).2) battery life is insanely good3) screen quality and brightness is top notch4) I LOVE the reversible screen. It's not a gimmick and actually is useful, especially when I have a headphone jack plugged in. I can now decide if I want the headphones jack to be on the bottom or the top.5) SD expansion. Enough said.6) near stock Android. I don't feel the need to add a launcher like I did with previous Samsung phones (s4, s5)7) cool features like a compass and fm radioCons1) music tends hiccup every now and then. Doesn't matter which player I'm using or how I'm listening (headphones or directly through the speakers). Was hoping that the update would fix but it didn't. Hopefully a future update will.2) no IR. I get it, it's a $250 phone so this is nitpicking honestly3) wish the battery was removable. This used to be a deal breaker for me but it seems to be the trend nowadays. Learning to deal.The camera is neither a pro or a con for me. It's not as good as the s6, g4 or even the s5. But it is as good or better than the m8 (don't know about the m9). It isn't bad by any stretch... Especially outdoors. (Sony lens).Bottom line is I love this phone. I'm sold and simply can't justify $700 or $800 for other flagships nor can I justify subsidizing or anything like that any longer. The idol 3, zenphone and moto g seem to be setting a trend in the smartphone world and it's exciting stuff. So glad I picked this up!EDIT: 6 months in and I'm sill loving this phone for all of the reasons above. Hoping for a Marshmallow update and now looking forward to a (hopefully soon) announcement for the idol 4.\n",

      "I've been playing with the phone for only a day. The Nexus 4 is my previous phone. There are many review articles and videos online about the Idol 3. Each stating about the same thing. Good enough but not great processing power. Good but not great camera. Close to stock Android. Big, bright and clear display. Poor button placement. I just wanted to comment on the many reviews that say the buttons are too high. I think the designers took into account that this smartphone will be handled by two hands by most people. Holding it in your left hand and using your right to navigate positions the buttons perfectly. Your left thumb is on the power with the left index on the volume. So people who buy this phone knowing to use two hands and they want value for their dollar... They'll find it difficult to beat this one. I for one am very happy with the product so far.\n",

      "If your a smart person and you are looking for a smartphone, this is the right phone for you! The Idol 3 is not a high-end smartphone like the samsung galaxy s6 or the lg g4, but it does deliver some pretty good performances and specs for the average user and you get this phone for around 1/3 the price. The camera is good but not for professional phototagraphers. The display is a full hd ips display and can be very birght. The phone is made of plastic but it has a nice brushed finish which makes it look premium. The Duel Front facing speakers are loud and clear. Now the reason I gave this product a 4 star is the performances and experiences I had recently. The double tap feature is sometimes laggy and sometimes I have to double tap multiple times to get the phone open. When I go on a heavy website on the web browser, I can barely scroll the screen. We will see an update for this phone however, and hopefully these issues will be resolved. In conclusion get this phone and stop thinking about those high end smartphones.\n",

      "I have never been as disappointed with an item from Amazon as I am with this one.First, some good points about the phone. The display and audio are top notch. Not even by grading on the curve of a $250 phone, they were as good or better than just about any flagship I've had. As good or better than any other display I've seen, and the front facing stereo speakers were amazing. No question about it. The phone performed fairly well, just a little bit slower than my 2013 LG Optimus G Pro, which had the same basic specs as this unit. The almost stock Android Lollipop was a nice thing to have, not much bloatware had to be removed. I changed the phone's supplied launcher to the Google Launcher and that gave the unit even more of a stock Android feel.I should have known I was in for a nightmare when I opened the phone and found that Alcatel didn't include the tool that's needed to pop out the SIM and SD card tray. It took a couple of hours to find something small enough to fit into the tiny hole that releases the tray, and since the phone arrived on a Saturday, Alcatel tech support was closed and Amazon was no help, offering to send a replacement phone that might arrive Monday, but most likely would come Tuesday. Glad I pay for Amazon Prime to get such speedy service when a product is defective. But I finally got the tray open and was able to insert the SIM and SD cards from my current phone. Turned the phone on and it immediately found AT&T, provisioned itself smoothly, and I thought I was off to the races. Boy, was I wrong.I spent almost two days migrating apps from my old phone to this one, arranging the icons on the screen where I wanted them (this phone only allowed 4 icons in a row while the LG had 5, so the NFC setup process couldn't replicate my current screen arrangement) and re-entering login and other information for all my apps. I have a fair amount of apps, so it took a while. In order to clean the cache and speed up the phone a bit after everything was \"just so\", I restarted the phone, something I've done with the ten or so other Android phones I've had over the years. When the phone came back up, I noticed that about a third of the app icons were gone from my home screens. Just gone. And when I tried to open a couple of other apps, I got a message on the bottom of the screen that the app wasn't installed.I know Android can do some funky things, so I waited about ten minutes to see if the information would show up on the screen and it hadn't changed, so I rebooted the phone again. When it came on, even MORE icons were missing from the home screens. I could find most (not all) of the missing apps in the app drawer and could launch about half of them. But some of the data was gone, with very little chance of getting it back. And since I lost more data the second time I restarted the phone, I wasn't really interested in restarting again and losing even more data.So the two days I spent getting the phone loaded up were blown the second I tried to restart it. I hardly call that a small bug, and looking around some developer forums, it doesn't seem to be a bug tied to Android 5.0.2, which is what the phone is running with an Alcatel layer over it. So it's either the Alcatel modifications or a hardware issue causing the problem. Either way, that kind of performance is completely unacceptable, and while I think the phone has some good parts to it and the price is right, if it's going to lose data, I can't trust it or continue to use it. Even my kid's $99 BLU phone is more stable than this device is.So back to Amazon it goes, along with the accessories that were supposed to arrive on Sunday but didn't come because Amazon made a deal with the Devil when they chose the USPS to handle its Sunday deliveries. All in all, about a $300 lesson that sometimes you get what you pay for, and in this case I got a useless, low quality phone on the inside that looks like a great phone on the outside.Oh, and one more thing. Amazon chose to ship the phone via USPS in a padded envelope, not a box. I found the envelope with the phone in it jammed in my mailbox with all my other mail, making for a very tight squeeze to get the envelope out of the mailbox without tearing it. So the phone had less protection than it probably should have had and went through the postal system, which could have led to some kind of a hardware defect. I'm not going to try my luck with another phone, especially if Amazon is going to use such an insecure way to ship the phone. I bet they don't ship S6's in envelopes. Just sayin'.Next time, I'll spend a little more money and get a phone I can trust.\n",

Sound is sharp and clear through front facing speakers. Great battery life. Reverseability works as advertised & is very handy. Being as this is from a second tier manufacturer I did not expect stellar quality or support. I was wrong. I got an OTA software update yesterday (7/13/2025) that was an unexpected surprise. Double tap to wake is now rock solid. Android software is nearly stock and any bloatware is easily removed, unlike other manufacturers I could mention (Samsung,LG, etc.). This phone replaced a Nexus 5 and IMHO is superior in every way.\n",

      "The Idol 3 has been provided an amazing experience for me at a third of the cost of some of the top-tier phones available on the market. At $250 this smartphone provides all of the functionality I would want from a daily driver and there are only a few nit-picky features (a better camera, ir blaster, wireless charging and dedicated shutter button) missing that I would need to have to \"upgrade\" away from this phone. The previous phones I have used in order are the Galaxy Note II, Moto X, and the Sharp Aquos Crystal and this phone blows them all out the water.Design and Size:Simply put, this phone feels great in the hand. The symmetrical design and lack of capacitive keys really make the phone seem much smaller than other phones of the same screen size. At 5.5\" this phone is relatively easy to use one-handed (and I have average to small-sized hands for a guy). It is also as light or lighter than my previous phones. It does not have \"premium build quality\" with metals or glass, but personally that has never mattered to me. Besides the customization of designing my Moto X nothing really stood out as \"me\" when looking to purchase other phones. But besides all that, the phone looks great. The brushed metal look works for me, and since it is plastic it works for my wallet as well. I have never had an issue with dropping this phone or it feeling awkward to use.Screen:This screen is great. It is 1080p, videos play well, colors pop, and I can take it out in the middle of the day and actually see the screen in direct sunlight. The size of the screen also makes reading text easier and videos feel immersive. It doesn't quite live up to the borderless Aquos Crystal experience, but there is no light leakage on this screen and it does better at an angle. Also, the screen responds well to the touch, even with a tempered-glass protective covering over it. That is something that cannot be said with the Sharp Aquos Crystal.Sound:I never realized how much having the front-facing speakers would improve the quality of gaming and video experiences. Being able to lay down the phone and watch a video without the output sounding muffled or indistiguishable from gibberish is awesome. I find myself watching videos on my phone more than ever because of the audio features. Additionally, the included JBL earbuds are a nice touch and the JBL Mix audio app is one of the coolest I have ever used. I honestly find myself making playlists just to work on my mixing and transitions between tracks. Just check out some videos on youtube to see the app for itself because honestly a description here won't do justice to how fun the app is.Operating System and features:Comes out of the box with lollipop and just updated to version 5.0.2 today. As with any android phone customization is really limitless so I won't spend time on that here. The reversible feature is pretty neat, and merits me echoing other reviews. If it was not for the button placement or the design of my screen protector there would be times when I pull my phone out of my pocket and have no idea it was upside-down. The fluidity with how it works really stands out for functionality, and I am suprized this has not been a feature in phones prior to the Idol 3.Battery Life:There are phones that will get you longer battery life, but I have never been able to kill my phone in just one day of daily use. I am not implying that it will be at 30% when you wake up the next day, but it is definitely an upgrade over my first gen Moto X. Not having to find a charger immediately when I get home from work provides a little more freedom to the daily grind. I know that usage varies by person, but outside of gamers I don't think moderate to light users will have too many gripes about battery life.Conclusion:Buy this phone. If you want a great experience at a great price, buy this phone. One of my best decisions in a while to take the plunge. Being an unlocked phone carrying no carrier bloatware and built in apps like Mix, File Explorer and Wifi Display actually adding to the experience, Im starting to see less and less reason to ever sign up for a carrier contract again. If you need financing options, there is an Amazon store card for that. At $250 though, you won't find yourself in much of a financial bind if you decide to pick one up.\n",

      "Honestly, I love this phone. I bought mine from Amazon Warehouse. Although it was used. It preforms well but my package didn't come with the jbl headphone, just apple headphones. As for most users, battery is a main concern. My idol 3 gets about four to five hours of screen one time. I would like to state I am a heavy battery user. Bluetooth enabled most of time for my moto 360 and Bluetooth devices. Data also enabled for couple hours. For my opinion, this is an average phone, battery wise. Buy a fast charger for this phone as it only comes with a standard alcatel charger. The NFC and the Gyroscope sensor work very well for VR streaming. On board speakers are greatly better than most phones due to the dual front facing features. The camera is just good. Nothing to write home about. I highly advise y'all to buy the \"A better camera unlocked\" app. There is also a free version if y'all are into that. The app will make the camera in par with the iPhone cameras. If y'all are wondering about the double tap to wake feature. I'd like to say it works but only with the one touch launcher. It might just be a software issue with the marshmallow upfate. Hope alcatel fixes it soon. As of now. I use nova launcher with the knock lock app and the gravity lock app. Works well in unison.Overall. Great phone for the $200 mark. I did get mine used and for cheaper the price. Nothing bad. Hope this review helped your decision to consider this phone. Thanks bye bye\n",

I would hold the power button for more then 20 seconds and no response, just the led light. I looked up the issue and it could be one of two problems. The firmware might be setting the phone to hibernation or there might be a loose connection with the power button and socket. I didn't want to void my warranty so I replaced the phone through amazon.I waited another 4 days for a new phone and the phone seemed fine, but the led light would constantly flash even when all apps and notifications were turned off. I let the phone go down to 0% again at work and tested if the phone would be able to turn back on again. I charged it for 5-6 hours this time and no responsive. The led light would turn on when charging and that would be it. I don't know if its my bad luck but i will be replacing it one last time. If it is true then the phone is only good to hold one charge!

They said it was the best phone under $300, blah blah you've probably seen all that too. Lets start with the good. It has a pretty decent camera and a nice big screen... that's about it. I consider myself to be a simple man, if I buy something, its because it's supposed to serve a purpose. This phone froze all of the time, not only did I experience the stutter others experienced, but it froze and it crashed often. At first I thought it was my fault, so I cleared all of my cache, deleted useless folders, downloaded cleaner apps etc. but nothing worked, the phone kept freezing, crashing, and rebooting itself when I was in the middle of things. I've had this phone about two weeks now and I've had it. In a rage, I twisted the phone in my hands until I had shattered the LCD, screen and mangled the housing. It felt awesome. All in all, I should have known better this phone was released in 2014 and we're living in 2016. Two years in the tech industry is a lifetime... don't make the mistake I made.

      "This phone is absolutely excellent. I have had it over a month now and it receives excellent coverage for T-Mobile on the Dallas and Austin Texas areas. The phone is very light and feels very nice to hold. The speakers are excellent and the headphones sound amazing but I have trouble keeping them in my ears even after changing the earbud inserts. Phone streams MLB.TV on the LTE network with no issues which was one of the main things I was hoping for. Battery life is excellent, I am not a hardcore phone user but it lasts me 2 days without charging which includes the mlb app, clash of clans, and facebook/google hangouts messaging. If you are looking for a new phone and not wanting to spend a fortune this phone is perfect choice. I have had no latency issues with the 5.0 Android build with it like I read. The screen is very vibrant and looks amazing.Cons: Like to pocket dial a lot but I heard Android is famous for that with emergency calling. No Camera button on the sides, I was very accustomed to it on my Nokia Lumia 925. Only 2 pages for shortcuts to apps, not sure if that is able to be changed or not. The double tap screen isn't as responsive as my wife's Sony Xperia.

There had been some camera issues (the main one for me being battery drain) but that's been improved. The \"tap to turn on\" feature works reliably now, the screen is beautiful, and it's fast with web and google play store browsing.The button locations may be a problem for some, but I find I use it upside down just as much as right side up. Since always use my phone left handed because I am doing something else (like writing or unlocking a door) with my dominant hand, it's nice to have those buttons where they are.... My hands are pretty small but dexterous so a little \"shimmy\" is not a problem given my case.I have only dropped it once-- it has no chips or scratches.Could not be more pleased at this point, but I don't think that my use is typical. However it TOTALLY works for me... NOW (good updates).\n",

      "The phone is very decent for its price. But as with cheap products, there is always a downfall.1. The phone has gotten visibly slower than when it came. It has been only around two months and already its speed has decreased by a certain amount.2. This issue is the more disappointing one: The back squeaks and clicks when you press against it. This probably means that the back cover has gotten loose somehow. I have never dropped the phone, nor do I use it roughly. I am very gentle with it, and only after 1 month of use (the other month was spent on a trip), the back is already loose. I am very disappointed and the return period is already over.I was very hopeful for this smartphone, but it seems that there is a reason why higher end phones are priced the way they are.\n",

      "I personally can't imagine needing to anything beyond this phone's capabilities. It handles everything I ask of it; combinations of texting, phone calls, Youtube, GPS, streaming video and audio services. I've read that the phone can bog down when you multitask too much with it, but I haven't noticed this with my usage. I use this phone which Cricket Wireless (which I would also recommend).Pros:-Screen is great (in brightness and picture quality).-Battery lasts the day unless I do really push it.-Speakers are crisp and decently loud.-The phone is responsive in processing tasks.-The rear camera takes decent pictures under any conditions I've tried.-The cost.Cons-Call quality could be a little better (this may be Cricket's fault) but the quality is good enough to not be an issue.-I wish the speakers were louder; I can't hear audio if I leave the phone on outside of the shower. I realize this is a pretty needy desire that I have.-The stock texting app is pretty terrible. I didn't use it long because one of its \"features\" is to set the date of all group texts to someday in 1970 which causes the message to auto sort to the bottom of the inbox list. Fortunately the Google Messaging app is free and a good replacement.-Bloatware. There isn't a ton of it relative to other phones but it still drives me crazy that I can't delete apps such as the aforementioned terrible texting app.-The screen seems overly sensitive (i.e. often selecting links as I try to scroll through a webpage). However, this may be due to my screen protector. However, I do find it very easy to click small links or buttons accurately.-The front camera isn't the best, but selfies are for nerds.Overall, I can't recommend this phone enough. I can't see a reason to spend more on a different phone. Most of my complaints were easily resolved or not that problematic. I will absolutely look at whatever the latest Alcatel offering is in a few years when it is time for a new phone.\n",

      "I love this phone so far. A few weeks ago my oneplus one had started to have some issues and I wasn't able to fix it... so I started looking for a new phone. I bought the moto x pure.... it was ok but for the price it wasn't as nice as my oneplus one and I also didn't like how flimsy the buttons were.. so I returned that and tried the blu life one XL which was supposed to be decent (I've had a blu phone in the past and liked it)... I tried it and it was sooo slow.. so that went back. After researching I was torn between the idol3 and the zenfone2... both have great reviews. I chose the idol because of the speakers on front and I'm glad I did. The phone feels great in the hand. Call quality so far is good even in my house and the speakers sound great. The screen is clear (I would suggest pushing the display brightness up a bit) and the reverse call feature is pretty cool. (You can set a feature to have the phone screen to rotate no matter how you are holding it) The only thing that I don't like is the power button is hard to reach and I have long fingers.\n",

Beginning of October I had issues with my Sd and Sims slot not reading. I contacted Alcatel concerning the problem and was told I would have to send my phone in to be repaired for 15 days. When I asked why so long and I quote their customer service person said \" I sent you the email so do what you want\". I complained on Twitter the Alcatel company contacted me about the problem saying they needed more information it's been a week still have not spoken to anyone or gotten help with this problem. Horrible customer service horrible phone. I guess you pay for what you get! 😫👎🏽😡😡😡😡😡. Final verdict all Alcatel could for me was offer me a free shipping label. If you purchase this product and it breaks you have to send it in to there repair center. They did not offer to replace the phone or even send a refurbish phone. Phone in the garbage like there company is garbage. I would not buy this phone.\n",

Well im not really a swing vote on Android vs Apple, but this phone In my opinion is equivalent to the Iphone 6, same size, same camera, same speed. Literally almost all the specifications are there except this one you can have a much bigger memory slot, since its changeable. And its 3x cheaper. I read multiple reviews on different phones, and This one is the best buy for its buck. the 4.7 inch screen is Okay, if you have the money go buy that one, but if you have the extra money, just buy this one. I also recommend a case for this, since without one its slick as ice in your hand.\n",

      "I have had it for 2 months now. It definitely is a great phone, but does have some shortfalls. The phone is well built and although made of plastic, does feel like a very good solid build - almost as solid as an Iphone, without the weight. Screen is good, although I tend to keep my brightness at 60% to get a comparable display to my iphone. The colors are not as luch as my iphone - a tad washed out but after a while you dont even notice. the sound of the external speakers is amazing! I love it. the sound of the phone with headphones/earphones, both good quality and the ones it came with it, is good - but very low - no matter what app i use to watch videos/hear music, i find it to be a little low for my taste. The vanilla OS is awesome, but after installing just a few apps and 2 months use, the phone now feels very sluggish and and slow.. I find myself constantly having to clean my ram etc. For the price point, its OK.. I think it should cost a little lower considering other phones out there in the under $200 range which easily outperform this device. my true love and reason for buying this phone is the thickness and feel of it... besides that, didnt fine much special about it. Also, my phone appeard to be a 're-pack' as the box was not sealed, and my headphones were defective. I called Alcatel support for an exchange on the headphones and they were very nice and said they will simply send me out a new pair. That was two months ago, i never got anything. I still have to call them again. sux i have to chase them down for something I purchased (supposedly) brand new. the 3 stars however are for the phone, and have nothing to do with the headphone/used phone experience.\n",

      "I ordered this phone after seeing the advertisements on tv and I love it!! I was in a desperate state after my previous phone was forced to update to Lollipop after several years of running flawlessly. Unfortunately, Lollipop did not agree with my phone and within an hour I had a nonfunctioning brick. The Alcatel ONETOUCH is by far the best phone I've had and really saved my bacon because my other option was a $600+ phone that I really couldn't afford. Yes, I will admit it takes some getting use to. It's touchy, so when searching on the internet you can accidentally open multiple pages when scrolling, within a few days I was able to figure out the sweet spot on the screen to get around this problem. The sound quality is good which is a problem I read other people had. Picture quality is awesome so far. I've only had the phone for a few months so it's not like I've been in many situations to test the camera's limits, but for day to day use it's pretty solid. When I took this phone to get a new SIM card the tech guy raved on and on about how great the specs are and how it's such a great deal. I can't really speak for that because I have no idea what the specs are in comparison to others. He fiddled with it for a few minutes and in that time 3 people who were trying to get new phones left to order this one. It really is the best deal out there. I was slightly worried about how it would respond to my network (t-mobile) but it runs perfectly. I have no complaints and have recommended it to everyone I know. In fact my mom and dad were due for an upgrade and I order these for them and they love them too.\n",

      "Let me start by clarifying the title. While this device may not match up to the current flagships on the market, keep in mind that this is last year's model. Going from an LG G4 to this phone, the only noticeable downgrade was the camera and the non removable battery. That being said, the camera is still better than all of my older flagships except that one, and while the battery isn't replaceable, it still outlasts what my G4 would with the same usage. I sell phones for a living and as a bit of a phone enthusiast, I've used every major brand of phone either for personal use or I've set them up or performed troubleshooting for customers. Alcatel is a brand that I've seen very hit or miss devices come from, so I was a bit leary buying one. I have to say I don't regret it one bit. At the new price of $99 it's a no brainer. If you're looking for a phone that gets stuff done for under $200, this is it. The sound is fantastic, the processor is very snappy even though it's not the very top of the line snapdragon. The phone's design is brilliant and it looks and feels great. There is no real bloatware other than all of the Google apps, and the launcher is clean and very close to pure android. As with any phone, don't forget protection. It will last for you as long as you don't abuse it, and Alcatel does stand behind their warranty so if it does happen to malfunction they will fix it. This phone is what I've been waiting years for. You can't get a better phone at this price point.\n",

At first, the battery would die once it hit 95%. I would have to put the phone back on the charger and wait for it to reboot up and charge back up to 100, then less than an hour later it would happen again. Eventually it stopped allowing me to do anything at all. Alcatel has no real support, save a call number that will not do anything for you. I tried replacing the battery, but same issue continued. I took it into a local repair shop and after three weeks they gave it back to me and refunded all charges, telling me that it must be a software issue, because the battery and charging ports work fine. However, because Alcatel doesn't have any real customer troubleshooting or service, I have no way to fix it. There is a reason people buy from trusted companies with well established reputations for troubleshooting and repairs.

      "Hello! After around 6 full months of owning this phone, I'd like to share my 2 cents.I bought this back in October and I am an AT&T costumer. It was a simple process of transferring my SIM card form my previous (much older smartphone) to this new Alcatel Idol 3. I had bought a 64gb memory card to go along with it and again, the installation was super simple and really easy. Both the SIM and memory card sit side-by-side like buddies in a tray that pops in and out of the phone using a thin wire -- such as a paperclip.Anyway, down to the phone itself. I love it. It has met and exceeded my needs and I've used it A LOT in these six months. Like a lot a lot. Everyday for a few hours at least. I do everything from playing games on it, surfing the web, playing videos (lots of youtube!), playing music, reading articles, and of course, calling and texting -- because it's a phone.Here is what I absolutely LOVE about this phone:- The screen. Oh boy the screen. This thing has a beautiful, incredibly BRIGHT screen. I actually have it on the lowest brightness setting, because anything higher than that it is too bright haha. It's really a gorgeous screen. Full HD, 401ppi. Looks great. Again, can get VERY bright.- The RAM and processor. The combination of these two have met my needs with hardly any problems. I've had multiple, high-demanding apps running in the background (games, YouTube, Torrent clients) and the phone does well to keep up with what I throw at it. It does slow down eventually and can appear like it's struggling, but I can imagine that'd be the case with any device after meeting its threshold.- The speakers! I don't use them much, but man oh man when I do, they're a joy. This phone has excellent front facing speakers that really do fill a room. I use this phone for my alarm and every morning hearing this thing blast away some beautiful sounding tunes is a real treat to wake up to.- Build quality. This is not only a nice-looking phone, but if feels well built and constructed. Quite a bit nicer than the price-tag would hint at. I was, and am, thoroughly impressed with it. I've managed to take good care of it, so there's no noticeable scratches on both the backside and the screen. And none have randomly appeared.- The battery! Oh jeez. So when I say that I use this phone A LOT. I sure mean it, and this battery holds up REALLY well. On the way to work, at work, and upon arriving back at home I am usually left with a good chunk of battery life -- 30-40%. It very rarely dips below 20% on a given day, which is freakin' awesome.Things I like about it, but could be better:- It's thin and lightweight. I was super surprised by how thin and light it was and actually very nervous about handling it. However, upon buying and putting on a decent size case which added a little bulk to it, the phone size is just about perfect. But I wouldn't mind it being a bit heavier and maybe a touch thicker, just so if I did end up dropping it I wouldn't feel like it would explode.- The Camera. This takes a bit of trial and error, such as finding an appropriate app that will utilize the camera to it's fullest. The camera is not \"oh wow! Look at that!\" great when I first used it. I had to get accustomed to where and how it worked best. For example, it's not great in low-light environments. Taking a picture at night? Uh, forget about it. It's rough times. But in daytime, with lots going on and lots of things to focus on, the camera does surprisingly well and can -- on occasion -- take some truly spectacular pictures. But those times are few and far between. So I'd recommend finding a different phone if you really want a nice camera on a phone, BUT for the most part this guy does the trick -- just be a bit prepared for figuring out its limitations. Also, the front-facing \"selfie\" camera is surprisingly nice! The few selfies I've taken have turned out better than I'd like to admit!- The pre-installed launcher. Eh, it's not great, but it's not terrible. It can get sluggish and doesn't look the best. There are other options out there that are far better. Also, many of the pre-installed apps sort of fall into the same boat. They're not great, but they're not terrible. I really wish the file managed was better though, because it seems to be the only app that you can voluntarily copy and move files between the internal storage and the micro sd card. Ugh, I think that might be an android issue though...- Sound quality, internal audio amp/driver. Now, I ain't no audiophile or anything like that, but I do appreciate a nice sounding device paired with a nice set of earphones. This phone, similar to its camera, gets the job done, but again there isn't that \"wow! Listen to this!\" feeling. I wasn't buying the phone for its audio capabilities -- internal audio driver -- but with it's awesome external speakers and its partnership (somewhat) with JBL I have to say that I was expecting more. I've used a number of apps with different audio files, but I've owned past devices that have sounded significantly better. Anyway, it's no deal-breaker, but it is a thing and if you're looking for a device with great sound quality, I'd look elsewhere.Overall, I am super happy with this phone. I bought it back when it was $250, and I am shocked it has dropped down to $200. It's a steal at that price. It really is. It's no flagship, IPhone destroyer, but it gets the job done with battery to spare! I really do like it and I think if you're an AT&T costumer looking for a new smartphone for a smart price, then this is it. Everything I've asked it to do -- both usual and ugh...unusual hahah -- it has executed well.If you do end up getting it, here are a few parting recommendations:- purchase a 64gb micro sd card. They're cheap, awesome, and easy to install- Get a case! It makes the phone a bit bigger and easier to handle. I don't like screen protectors, so I can't speak about those.- Look into finding a camera app for the phone. I bought one on Google PlayStore called Cameringo+Effects and I really like it. Just make sure to set it to HD pictures. It'll seem like it has a smaller viewing screen, but the quality of the photos are a TON better than the default picture quality on the app.- Look into finding a different launcher for the phone. I got Nova Launcher Prime and it makes the phone's interface speedier and more user-friendly, and you can customize it off the wazoo.Alright, well that's my 2 cents on this phone. Overall, I think it's great and at $200, it's quite the stealio.\n",

      "I have had this phone almost one year in about two weeks. I wrote a review on Alcatel's website. To my dismay when I checked back on the review I wrote and how may stars I gave it, had been altered. The stars had been bump up from two to four stars and what I wrote edited by shortening the bad part of the review. I was absolutely disgusted. The phone itself is not bad for the price but the customer service is not good at all. I have heard similar complaints. And the complaints stem from questions to do with updates to the phone. The phone came with Lollipop 5.0. They do not respond when asked by customers regarding updates to the phone. Not on their website, Facebook or speaking to them. Speak to them on updates and they have no answer for you. Because of that I will never buy this phone again.\n",

      "Synopsis:I like it. it's not blowing me away, but for the price I knew it couldn't be perfect. I had to return one due to issues caused by an OTA system update, and the second one has a crackly headphone port, but otherwise it's been great. A fantastic alternative to the \"deals\" offered by the major carriers (I'm lookin at you, AT&T Next)The Phone: The Bad:Really just 1 thing: The headphone port is a little crackly. by that I mean if you plug in headphones, and nudge the the jack, the sound crackles, and you may lose audio in one ear until it sorts itself out. I know this may be a MUCH bigger issue for some people, but I've had devices with crackly headphone ports for years without failing, and really, I am rarely on the move with headphones on, and if I am, I'll be careful to make sure the jack isn't being jostled. I could return the phone again, but I'd have to take another refund and repurchase, and I'm not willing to have $600 tied up in pending Amazon refunds.The Good:Size:I was worried about the size initially. My old phone is a Galaxy 2 Skyrocket. It has a 4\" screen. I thought it was perfect. This took literally no time to get comfortable with. Yes, one hand operation is mostly gone, but it turns out that I don't even notice. It fits in pockets nicely and textured just enough to not be too slick.Screen:I'm no connoisseur of screens, but this thing seems excellent. In a dark room I actually wish it would dim a little more. No problems in full summer sun. colours, saturation and depth are great to my eyes.speakers:surprisingly good. Whatever they did with JBL worked. Similarly for the headphones. Far superior to any headphones I've ever gotten with a phone or music device.Reception:On par with my Samsung and my wife's Nokia Lumia. really like the notification for when I'm on LTE, H+, etc.Wifi:Like a few other devices ( XBox1), it doesn't seem to play well with my Comcast Xfinity home Wifi. Other places it's fine. That's a comcast issue.Camera:meh. it's got a lot of pixels and nice features, but images seem to be noisy when the lighting isnt perfect. My old Samsung was better. Supposedly better after the OTA update.Performance:smooth, fast. Gets a little hot with graphically intense games, but that's normal. Just a hair of lag when downloading/installing multiple apps. Nothing to fret over.UI:Less is more. It's simple, and seems just lightly massaged. preloaded apps are mostly what you'd want anyway.Battery:better than my old Samsung, I don't have a lot to put here. it holds up well to moderate use throughout the day.\n",

      "This phone is probably the best for the price. It has a really bright screen, it's thin, has an sd card slot, fast processor, and front facing speakers. And it has nfc, which the new moto g, oneplus 2, and huawei p8 lite don't have. It's also going to be updated to get protected from the \"Stagefright\" bug soon. Nice to see a company caring about users.However....While this phone was in a bag it got cracked. There was a case on it but it still got cracked. The digitizer did not work so I shipped it to alcatel for repair and it is costing me $100 for them to fix it.So please buy a tempered glass screen, and don't put any pressure on the phone. I even noticed that if you press hard enough you will see spots, I guess from the lcd.If you are looking for a phone that doesn't crack easy and is similar price I recommend the OnePlus One. I've hade it with a small orzly fusion case and it isn't cracked. It does have a tempered glass on it but that's only been recently.\n",

      "After using the phone as my daily driver for a month I can honestly say this is one of the best experiences you can have off a budget smart phone. I use the term budget for the description of the price range however the experience is that of a flagship phone. In this review I will talk about the design, hardware, usability, and daily experience of the phone.DesignIts not secret that at this price range you are going to get a plastic phone. With that aside its one of the nicest builds. It have a solid but light feel in the hand. The back is make of a matte metallic sheen that is pleasant to the touch and is not slick and will not attract finger prints. Another note is that the back of the phone is completely flat including the camera does not protrude from the body of the phone. Their is a nice chrome lip all the way around the edge front and back that breaks up the black and gray quite tastefully. Lastly the phone is completely symmetrical. The top and bottom are completely identical with the exception of the excellent front camera and photo-sensor and there is a reason for it. I'll explain more in the experience section.HardwareDespite the price this prince is running a Snapdragon 615 octa-core with 4 cores at 1.5ghz and the other 4 at 1.0ghz and 2GB of ram. It has wifi with 5ghz band and 2.4ghz support. I can say that the wifi works well and has great range (helps if you have a good router as well). LTE is band 12 capable for those who will be using T-Mobile. The rear facing camera is a 13 megapixel Sony sensor with a 8 megapixel front facing camera but shoot at 4:3 aspect ratio. If you want 16:9 HD photos the sensor will go bring the pixel count down to 9.4 mega pixel and 5.1 on the front camera. The display is a bright and beautiful 5.5 inch IPS HD display running at 1920x1080P with 401 pixels per inch. And to tight everything together are JBL powered stereo speakers with 2 microphones one on top and bottom of the phone. All that powered by a 2915mah battery.UsabilityI had a Motorola X (2013) which made usability far better than any phone with its gestures and touchless command prompts beyond what OK Google can do. After having that experience its hard for any phone to compete with that. Going from a 4.7 inch display to a 5.5 inch was quite a jump however thanks to the minimal bezels its make it easy to use. I have small hands and reaching across the screen to the left and the top was a little hard put its still possible. The stereo speakers make it a harder because of the extra bezel it creates still nothing compared to the LG G3 or I phone 6 plus for that matter. The phone is very thin and light making completely unnoticeable in my pocket compared to the weight and thickness of my Moto X. Having the big and bright display with stereo speakers made every media experience amazing. The sound was rich and crystal clear, with good highs and mids, low lows but still better than any other phone out there. The photo-sensor works really well with its software. The screen always had the right amount of brightness, never to much indoors in the dark and you can see the display clearly in direct sunlight not problem. The front facing camera is just a dream with selfies (not that I do much) but video chatting and conferencing is just amazing. Google hangouts is a power app and the phone handles it not problem streaming HD and close to 30fps on a good internet connection. The display also runs at 60fps and drops a bit when moving around but its not even noticeable unless you are watching a fps monitoring software.ExperienceThe as a whole runs pretty smooth about 90% of the time. There are delays in opening apps in comparison to the top flagship phones but its only .5 sec behind in opening apps compared to the galaxy S6 or i Phone 6 plus. Once the app is open or in the ram it responds instantly with no lag. The home screen, multi-task bar, and quick setting menu from the top are lag free. Honestly its runs almost as well as any flagship to the point where you question why you are paying $700+ for a phone. The delay is never frustration or interfering with your task but its noticeable compared to the top flagships. I actually found myself preferring my phone speakers over my Bluetooth speakers because of the clarity was far superior. The phone is running a stock 5.0 android experience with an icon pack install with the Acatel launcher. I actually just installed the google now launcher for a more complete stock look. Not a fan of the bright looking icons on the Acatel launcher. The camera is a pretty awesome however the stock camera app is a flop. The image processing is horrible. I installed the google camera app and it did a much better job with the camera and image processing plus it gives you the ability to change aspect ratio and megapixel options. After all this the batter is a big plus. Its a true all day battery with normal usage and even powers users can get a good amount of usage before needing to charge. I was able to get 6.2 Hrs of on screen time watching Netflix through wifi. When power using during the day I got 4-5 hrs of on screen time. Over all if you want a flagship phone without the flagship price brand new, this is it. There is nothing that compares with it.\n",

      "I've only had this phone for 48 hours. It took less than 24 (including sleep) to have it set up with my favorite stuff. I continually use bluetooth and I'm REALLY active on my phone. Multiple email accounts and multiple active social media accounts. I can still get a full business day, plus some, on a single charge. Despite also still spending lots of time tweaking.It's said the camera may not be up to those of the flagship phones. I haven't tried the camera, yet, to verify that. But keep in mind that the flagships sell between $500-800+ and the Idol 3 is $250. One would expect a difference. Likewise, with the software. Some things have a perceptible difference in opening speed, but not enough to call them slow. And accessories are limited.In contrast, connections are stronger and faster than any previous device I've owned. I happen to live in an area where signal is weak and maybe a little flakey. There are hills and lots of brick homes blocking the two closest towers. Both cell and wifi are faster and cell strength is better. And it handles a 128 gig microsd card.The Idol 3 isn't a flagship killer. But, at the price, one would expect \"good enough\". And it's much closer to flagship than \"good enough\". If you need the fastest and the best, get a flagship. If you want a smartphone that can stand on its own merits, but allows you to spend your money on more important things, this is what you want.\n",

The cameras are both pretty impressive for the price, the processor handles every game I play without any hiccups but it does come off a little sluggish outside of the games. Aside from the icons, this phone is basically pure android. I've thoroughly enjoyed it, its the best electronic device I've ever paid 250 for but if you are pure android lover and a power user, you'll enjoy this as a back up to a nexus.\n",

      "I received my phone on yesterday and must first say I appreciate all the previous reviews that guided me to this purchase. I did some research on this phone including YouTube videos that compared this phone to other budget phones and flagships. This phone has met all of my expectations and then some! I saw remarks about the double tap not being consistent. I actually figured that out. If you do a slower tap it usually works every time. Maybe a quick could \"1,2\" works just about every time. The battery seems good so far. The display is outstanding. I downloaded open camera after a reviewer suggested which is good. My 2 most recent phones were the LG g4 and galaxy s6. The s6 is certainly a great piece of equipment but I realized many of the features they offer I don't need and the price is just too much. I definitely recommend this device over any other android on the market. Even some iPhone users might like this as a temporary, secondary or converter back to the android platform.\n",

      "This is a review after one week of usage. As a baseline for the review, I am not a power user. I only use it for phone calls, texting, checking email, and surfing when I'm not near a computer. For these purposes and needs, this phone is great (so far):- Phone is thin and light. Slim case serves my needs because does not add bulk but still adds protection- Phone looks visually nice (compared to direct competitors like the Zenfone and One Plus)- Screen is big and bright- Sound is way better with two front facing speakers- Battery life lasts the whole day with some to spare- Camera is good (enough). Good for impromptu moments. Don't have high expectations and you will be very pleased with the resultsLag is relative. I don't mind a delay of a nano-second to see what I need or do what I want to do. Overall, I am happy (so far) of the purchase of this phone. It fits my needs perfectly with the price point, features, and aesthetics. I think the Idol 3 is worth more than the $250 retail price. The only difficult part is telling people what phone I have. Alcatel is not a household name, nor is it easy to pronounce. A lot of people ask me about the phone and telling them about Alcatel is the biggest hang up for me. However, I was with T-Mobile when they first started. I was also with Samsung from the beginning. Hopefully I'll hit again with Alcatel.\n",

      "I purchased this after reading great reviews and I couldn't be more satisfied for the price. This phone's sound is unbelievable, and the screen is every bit as good as my Galaxy S4. Very lightweight for the large size. Love that I can add/change memory card via a pop-out tray on the side. One potential drawback for heavy phone users is nonremovable batter, but great for average phone use, music, podcasts and video. Good camera with plenty of options, too. Unlike some lower-priced phones, has latest version of Lollipop.\n",

I love it features sometimes I feel like I'm using a Nexus. No Andriod 5.1.1 yet but who cares you're getting a lot for your money! Sometimes I forget this is not a flagship.

      "I've been using Amazon for almost a decade now. My household spends hundreds if not thousands on amazon purchases annually. I'm not a product review sort of guy. I typically just read through everyone else's comments to determine if a product is worthy or not. Amazon reviews have rarely steered me wrong. In this case I must make an exception and share my experience with the Alcatel one touch idol 3. I love everything about the phone.....except the quality of screen materials. It scratches, and I don't mean a little. I have had all types of phones over the years. Flagships to burners, but I have never experienced such a scratch prone one as the Alcatel. I ALWAYS use a case, but have never bothered with a screen protector since I am very careful with my electronics thus the screens remained pristine. I was very proud of my new bargain phone with flagship specs....until I noticed multiple scratches appear out of nowhere. They are increasing as well so the only possible conclusion is the phone was scratched by pulling it in and out of my pocket...seriously! Nobody else touches my phone, no kids, no pets, no nothing. Well the damage is done, I will put up with it I suppose as the other features of the phone are amazing. You have been warned, good luck my fellow shoppers!\n",

      "The performance on this phone is really choppy and it has a lot of lag. Your only able to play a few games without lag but graphic intensive games are going to lag you like crazy. I can't even play something like Dumb Ways to Die 2 without lagging incredibly and that game isn't even graphic intensive. Also, when I only use it for a few minutes it gets extremely hot to the touch on the back, even if I'm just browsing the web it will get really really hot to the point that it stings. The camera is okay...its not that great but it performs really well when there is good lighting but with bad lighting it's super blurry and there is really little detail. Opening apps is a pain in the ass because it takes forever for them to open. Just so you know it has a notification light but with only one color and the double tap to wake sometimes is really unresponsive. But two things that's extremely good about this phone is the speakers and the display. The speakers are extremely loud and the display is really sharp and the colors on the phone are pretty accurate has good contrast. The brightness on this phone when turned max is crazy bright and going outside in the sun won't be a worry when using this phone. I gave it a three instead of something lower because of the speakers and display. Oh yeah the headphones that this phone comes with is really awesome but you gotta be really careful around the tip of its plug thingy since if you bend it, it will break. That's what happened to mine. I only had it for a few months and its already broken so I can't even use it to listen and now I have to use my other headphones.\n",

Upon using it for a few months now I have to say that it feels as slow as the Google Nexus (the dual core one by Samsung). The screen managed to develop a tiny yellow spot that seems like someone went over it with a highlighter that won't go away. Buttons are becoming increasingly unresponsive and a refresh of the device hasn't helped.Battery is very average.It's wonderful for watching/listening to shows as the screen still looks pretty decent, especially at that size, the speakers are great, and the included ear buds are pretty decent as well.Still, even after a month of owning this thing I was already disappointed it in. If you need a new phone, it's decent, especially at $250, but the interface is sluggish and unresponsive.\n",

      "I decided to buy this phone on a whim after reading several early reviews. I'm glad I did. No, it's not perfect, but you have to consider what you get for your money. Other reviewers have gone into great detail about pros and cons so I won't repeat here. There are a few quirks, but in my opinion, the pros far outweigh the cons. I thought there was a problem with my external SD card when I couldn't access files on the card. It turned out my card was formatted in exFat. Once I formatted it to Fat32, all was well. When I was setting up my phone I somehow lost 2 screen panels and ended up with only one. I had to factory reset and that cured the problem. Also, sometimes the screen digitizer can be a little balky. The speakers are quite good as are the included earbuds. Maybe not as good as HTC's, but still good. The screen is very good for a phone at this price point. The camera was also a pleasant surprise. No, it won't beat the Galaxy S6 or iphone6, but you won't be disappointed either. I found no lag others have mentioned, but then again, I don't play games or launch multiple apps at once. For what I do, it was as smooth as butter. You will get through a day on the battery unless you are a heavy user. Unless you're a true perfectionist, I can't imagine anyone being disappointed with this phone when they consider it cost $250 for a no-contract, unlocked phone.\n",

      "Over all, it's a decent phone, but there's some downsides to it.1. The camera is not going to beat any of the flagship cameras or really any dedicated digital camera.2. It does get hot from time to time (it seems there's similar reports for phones running the Snapdragon 615 chip, so that's the likely culprit).3. Although the screen is very bright, I've noticed it seems washed out from time to time.Aside from these downsides, I think it's still a decent phone over all. Call quality has been good for me. The phone has been plenty fast for most of my tasks which center around web surfing and checking out Facebook. And the battery life is much better than my ancient S3. Over all, it's a phone I would buy again even if Alcatel doesn't provide regular updates (so far according to Reddit it can be rooted and the boot loader seems to be unlocked, so if you feel like experimenting with Cyanogenmod, it may be worth the trouble) in respect to the price.\n",

      "I was looking for a good but affordable phone in March/April of this year and I knew already I would have to buy a used or refurbashed phone. Good but cheap phones just do not exist, until now. Alcatel's usual fare is cheap and lackluster POS's with poor hardware. With the Idol 3 Alcatel has decided to up it's game and came out with their new flagship[ phone. Granted it's no high end flagship killer but for the money you get quite a bit of tech.The good- Beautiful, bright and large 5.5\" screen. Great visibility in sunlight!- 2 stereo front facing speakers that sound better that any other phone I have heard before.- Near stock Android Lollipop.- 2910mAh battery. Great battery life. On a slow day the phone could last 3 days for me easy. On a busy day it will last the day and then some.- Small dimensions for a big phone. One of the thinnest phones I have ever seen. Very light as well.- Build quality looks excellent. Phone looks sleek and stylish.- Camera is great in optimal conditions. Low light it's poor. Might be fixable in an update.- 16GB storage. I consider anything 16GB or higher a positive.- Storage expandable to 128GB with a micro SD card. I popped one in for my music and it's great (I have over 75GB of music and growing.)- Call quality while not being super is average for a cell phone. If you use the speaker phone option it sounds great.- Phone can be completely used upside down, even on calls!- Reception is great for me. Where as on my Samsung Galaxy S2 Skyrocket I was always getting 1-2 bars. On the Idol 3 I get 3-5 bars. However, reception will very greatly for each person.- SIM unlocked and usable on both AT&T and T-Mobile, including 4G LTE.- Free earbuds. Their not great but their decent and get the job done.- Of course the price!BadBesides the phone not having a removable battery (which is usually a must for me), I personally i can't think of anything bad on this phone. There are a few small things but these should all be fixable on software updates down the road. Alcatel has already conformed they will keep this phone updated for the standard lifespan of a cell phone, usually 18 to 24 months.- Phone can lag a bit. Use the close apps button on the recent apps screen to keep the phone performing optimally. Keeping unused apps out of memory will greatly affect performance. The processor is not the latest and greatest but it does it's job, especially for battery life.- Camera in low light conditions.That's about it for me. I was wary about buying an Alcatel phone as I usually buy either Samsung, HTC or LG but this is a very nice and affordable phone. I highly recommend this phone.*** UPDATE ***Alcatel sent out a performance update less than 2 months after release. I know of only one other company that does faster updates so this is pretty good. I don't know all the things that were in the update but I can say is that it fixed the following issues: UI lag (the user interface no longer has lag when using it), Double Tap to Wake works perfectly now, some minor camera issues were fixed. cell signal dropping sometimes when using LTE was fixed. Also there were a few UI and camera tweaks added as well. Overall the update was great and makes the phone perfect.\n",

Price is right for something pretty close to flagship specs. It does intend to get a bit hot on the back so I just put a case on it.

      "To preface this review: I am coming from a Nexus 4, which had served me well up till the most recent Android updates, which have been buggy and have killed the battery life on what was previously an almost perfect device.Now, onto the Idol 3: It's a gorgeous phone, with a big, bright & crisp screen and lovely design. The UI has been lightly skinned, which is a good thing as I'm a fan of stock Android. Benchmark scores aren't top notch, but they blow away the Nexus 4 and are just about on par with the Samsung S4. For the price, you're getting a lot of phone here.Yet, there are some significant areas for improvement: Shutter speed is quick but indoor photos are noisy. There's a bit of general UI lag, which isn't that obtrusive. These issues aren't monumental considering the price. More concerning: when browsing certain Flash-heavy sites using Chrome or the stock browse, such as ESPN or Boston.com, the browser lags/stutters to the point that it's essentially unusable. This is a serious issue as we obviously use our phones as portable web browsers a lot. To have a phone that can't navigate well through who knows how many different sites is a near deal-breaker. Other users on various web forums are experiencing the same thing, so it's not just me. Also note that I haven't overloaded the phone with a ton of random apps to muddy the waters.I've only had the phone for a day or two, so hopefully this is a launch issue, but if Alcatel can't push an fix within the next couple of weeks, this thing is going back.3-stars with the stuttering browser issue, otherwise, this is a 5-star phone.\n",

      "Absolutely love this device. Once I heard Alcatel was selling a phone with such good specs at such a low price I jumped at the pre-order and I am so glad I did. Although the phone was delivered to my neighbor, and after some worried searching saw it on their porch, I have no problems since my order was upgraded to two day shipping.The device is very light weight and very thin. Its screen is beautiful and very bright. Full, rich color from all viewing angles. The speakers are much better than expected, very loud with solid lows and sharp highs. The headphones provided are of very good quality with phenomenal sound and deep bass. The rear camera is quite good for videos but sub par for stills. The quality in a low light setting is very dull and scratchy. The front camera is a different story. Very rich detail and contrast with a very noticable difference in a low light setting, the pictures are much clearer.The battery is very good. With an average day of usage mostly consisting of YouTube and Facebook I had almost 35% left at the end of the day.The snapdragon processor is a big plus in this device. It is very snappy and holds its own in demanding apps. There is a little lag only when clearing recent apps.The android 5.0 is excellent and very clean on this device.Although the phone is made out of plastic, I must say it has a very durable and quality feel to it. Since the back cannot be removed there is no creaking when force is applied.Overall I must say that this phone is worth every penny and I would highly reccomme d to anybody on a budget.\n",

      "Update 7/15/15: Alcatel recently released an update for the phone. While it fixed the double tap to wake issue that previously worked inconsistently, it broke Google Voice interception of outbound calls. Therefore, this phone is nearly unusable to me as a phone, since my primary number is a Google Voice number. As a very inconvenient workaround, I now have to load the Google Voice webpage in order to make a call. I am now considering to replace this phone and do not recommend it to anyone who uses Google Voice to make outbound calls. If you already have this phone and use Google Voice, DO NOT INSTALL THE LATEST UPDATE!---------------------------------------Original review:The Idol 3 is an excellent phone for the $200 pre-order price. At the $250 regular price, I recommend weighing the pros and cons against two-year old flagship phones that sell for a similar price. I am looking forward to Alcatel addressing some of the \"cons\" listed below with a firmware update.Pros:- Beautiful, 5.5\" screen- Good battery life- Android Lollipop experience without the unnecessary clutter- Very good speakers for a cell phone- Micro SD card slotCons:- Double tap to wake feature is so unreliable that it may as well not exist- Minimum volume setting for notifications and ringtones is too loud- Screen sometimes does not go to sleep after set time period- Poorer performance in day-to-day use (non-intensive apps, web browsing, e-mail) than 2-year old flagship phones that now sell for the same price, such as an LG G2- Home screen should have the option of fitting 5 columns of icons instead of just 4- Poorer low-light camera performance than an LG G2 (too much noise)- Non-removable battery- High, hard-to-reach power button\n",

However my phone came with a non-functioning gesture keyboard. And if that was not bad enough I attempted to call Alcatel to try and resolve the issue. First I download Alcatel support app, it has a 800 number that is non-functional (strike 1). Then I tried to call a number listed in the manual, no one is there on weekends and holidays, (strike 2). And last but not least is the question who releases a phone so that it arrives on a holiday weekend and does not have support available in any fashion what so ever. (strike 3). While I did fix the keyboard issue by downloading a free keyboard app I would like to have the original equipment/software work properly. Searching on the web found others complaining about the same issue and no help on their website. Buy at your own risk.\n",

      "BUY A SCREEN PROTECTOR ASAP!!!!I consider myself a pretty careful person when it comes to my electronics. I underestimated myself this weekend and it dropped on the floor of a bus, I was shuffling my feet without knowing the phone was face down on the floor and boom.. scratched screen. Screen protector was already on order and being delivered the following monday :( Totally my fault obviously, but just wanted to warn you guys to definitely get a screen protector and do not chance it with this phone, because almost all the features on this phone are awesome for the price!Screen is beautiful and bright and clear, reminds me of my samsung note 2 AMOLED screen, very clear. keeping the costs down had to be taken somewhere and it is the non scratch resistant screen.Speed seems adequate. I havent really tested its full potential but this is going to be my second phone.sound is AMAZING, JBL speakers and it really shows, Even when plugging it into my car, the sound seems better than my previous phone.Camera app needs some work, or maybe just a different app would work. I was hoping it would take better macro pictures and focus fast on that type of scene but it doesn't for me.size is similar to my note 2, a little bit too big for my hand. But its pretty thin which makes up for that.The power button and volume buttons are high up so reaching them takes some hand maneuvering. you might not think of it much, but once you notice it..Battery life seems pretty good, you could probably get a good day and a half with normal/light usage. It seems like a stock version of android 5.0 lollipop with no bloatware which helps a lot with battery life as well.Overall I think for 200 this is a great deal. Just wish i didn't jump the gun and use it unprotected.Update #1:browsing around the Google app store, I found Open Camera, which is a great alternative to use,. It has a lot of features and macro mode which I was complaining about, and this phone seems to take great macro photos at about 5 inches away.Update #2: Camera app alternativeI had a chance to do some outdoor macro photos and I am VERY impressed with how it did! Using Open Camera and having it on macro mode setting, focusing was for the most part pretty quick and I added some photos to see.Update #3 - 11-5-16 Sold phone a long time ago..Sorry can't provide any further updates on this phone. Judging by the Amazon price for this phone, there are plenty of other phones I would rather get with equal or better specs.\n",

      "Many reviews seem to be based on high end phone users looking at a value phone, my review is a different angle, I kicked the contract phones my last iPhone was a 5s, went to att pre pay, and the worst phone I ever owned, forget what it was, then to att's best prepay phone I could find at the time, a galaxy express, and it was OK, but getting old, time for a upgrade, looked at all att prepay phones and what a joke, and learned about the whole unlocked phone thing. The idol 3 cost less than my old express did, is a major upgrade in every aspect, screen, speakers, memory, and processer you name it.What lag there is , is nothing like my old express, the idol 3 zips along just fine, a studder closing all apps is all I have found, my express would lock up. Even the camera is leaps over what I had.Do hope to see a 5.1 upgrade?Anyway for a value phone, the idol 3 is hard to beat. Recommenced.\n",

      "But there are just a few too many issues that it's hard to ignore. Alcatel should absolutely take one more iteration on this phone and they will have something just about perfect.First let's talk about the pros:- Price - absolutely amazing value for the buck- Speedy - plenty fast enough for almost anyone needs, very fee stutters navigating around- camera is actually one of the best I've used outside of a very few phones- almost everything not listed as a con. Seriously this thing is very good overall.Now the cons, which are minor, but eventually they will become deal breakers:- Bluetooth audio is very very hollow sounding. Any media (music, podcasts, phone calls) sounds like you're listening to it over a tin can telephone. If you ever use Bluetooth you'll notice this almost immediately.- Power button in an un-intuitive location. Seriously guys it's standard on Android to have the volume and power button on the right side. Having volume on the right and power on the left is just a needless change. Just put it where everyone else does.- It may just be my device, but a week ago the combination SIM tray and SD card tray (in an of itself a real pain to load and unload) just seemed to stop working. My photos stopped backing up and calls wouldn't go through. I'd get a replacement but with the other issues I'll just get a refund.Again I really like the idea Alcatel was going for and they should definitely just fix these few issues and will have a great flagship-level phone.\n",

I tapped, I pressed the power button and I even called it, mind you this was after the most recent update. I ended up having to do a hard reset on it, so far no further problems. The only thing that I don't like is that you don't have access to emojis on social media but other than its a very good phone definitely worth $250 bucks.UPDATE!!!!!!!Well I have had this phone for a while now and I loved it, the only problems Ive had with this phone are ones that Ive caused myself, as far as the phone messing up on its own, no problems. The worst thing about this phone is the screen is not durable at all, one tap against a chair and it cracks and the screen does not work, cant unlock it, cant do anything, my galaxy s3 is way more durable than this. I recommend getting a tempered glass protector for it and the most durable case you can, but generally as long as you have the tempered glass you can just about use any case you would like. Ive searched all over for a phone that might compare to this, tired of Samsung products and their UI and notification sounds, to poor for anything else that I might genuinely like, ran across the HONOR 5X but it doesnt have a reversible interface and it hasnt been released yet, I'm not patient enough to wait a couple months for reviews so I figure I will just order this again, Win WIn.\n",

I don't know how it happened which is the hardest part because I woke up last Sunday morning to a broken digitizer. I pulled the phone out of the lower pocket of my cargo shorts that it had resided in several times since purchase and there it was - that inch-long crack across the top right corner of the screen. Along with it came the disabled lower half of the screen to any input.I ordered a digitizer on ebay for $25 despite the lack of online tutorials for replacing anything on this new-ish phone. Please note - it is not very difficult to get into, but you will find it nearly impossible to reassemble this phone without having rendered it completely useless during disassembly!The design (speakers near the edges) doesn't lend itself to any sort of meaningful case usage.So, here I am back to using my nearly 3 year old Samsung Galaxy S4 :(I tried, Alcatel.\n",

So, I did my due diligence and researched sub $300 phones that I could replace it with. I came across the one touch 3 and the ASUS Zenfone. I decided to go with the One Touch because although it has less processor capacity and ram than the Zenfone it made up for it in battery longevity, screen quality, and front facing speakers.The reviews were so right. The screen is beautiful. The front facing speakers sound just as good as on the HTC One M9. I have not experienced ANY of the lag I experienced on the S6 Edge (probably because there is little to no bloatware running in the background.)The battery also provides about 1.5 hours more screen on time than the S6.Get this phone.

      "So far, a great phone. I did a lot of research when deciding on a new phone in this price range. I listen to a lot of music on the run and the tipping point in favor of the Idol 3, for me, was the front facing stereo speakers.I've had the phone for a few days now, and I'm very impressed with it. The user interface is pretty much stock Lollipop, which I really appreciate. There is very little bloatware/shovelware taking up memory and what there is can be easily removed. The camera is average and takes decent pictures under the right conditions. Bluetooth paired up with all my devices, even the more finicky devices that have given me fits in the past. Call quality is really good and the voices are clear on both ends. Signal reception has been the same as my old phone and I have had no issues connecting to the network. WIFI connections are as expected and I have had no issues.I dropped in a 128Gb micro SD card and it is working as expected. I haven't had a chance to test out the NFC connection, but It's nice to have this capability.The real shocker is the sound quality. The front facing stereo speakers are really impressive. They are loud and you can crank it up with no distortion. Everyone I've demo'ed this for has had the same reaction, \"Whoa, that is impressive\". Are you going to replace your home sound system? Of course not, But you get some pretty big sound from some pretty small speakers. The other surprise was from the included ear buds. I wasn't expecting much, but they sound pretty good for being included in the box. They have flat, no tangle cables and include different size ear pieces. They are a little flat sounding in the mid range, but not objectionably so. They won't replace my more expensive ear buds, but if these were the only ones I had, I'm not sure I would be that quick to replace them. I definitely won't be throwing these out.All in all I am very happy with this phone. It has great features and the sounds is incredible. On top of all that it functions well as a phone. In my opinion, this is a good value for the money.\n",

      "I\"m giving this phone a 3 because there seems to be (for me) a fundamental flaw in the ergonomics of the phone. The way the switches are set up they are never in the right place. Also, I seem to be constantly grabbing the phone and hitting the switches at the same time, which seems to try and shut the phone down, or take a screenshot of the phone, neither of which I like. It took me a while to figure out that when I was trying to shoot a photo I was gripping the phone in a manner that I hit the buttons and it kept shutting down.I've had similar android phones and never had this issue.The icons are cartoon-y (I put an icon pack in to create shortcuts so I didn't have to look at them) and the phone seems rather slow to respond (for example, when you change screens or shut down the open apps). The phone seems to work ok, when I'm not having trouble manipulating it, and the setup was relatively simple and straightforward (coming from another unlocked android).I would not buy the phone again, but will keep it for now as I don't want the hassle of getting another phone. My old one stopped working so this purchase, while researched, was made a bit more quickly than I might of liked.\n",

      "Just recieved the Idol 3 phone by Alcatel. I was a little sceptical about reading a lot of negative reviews about the camera on this phone, but I also own the Alcatel Pop One Touch, which takes very nice pictures usually without even using the flash! So, the first I did was to compare my old phone camera with the new one. I took the same pictures side by side, and this is what I found. Out of the box the new cameras exposure settings needed to be adjusted. If you click on the upper left of the camera screen, (there are three short lines), then choose settings--you will see exposure settings, click on the number 1 setting-- (Not -1). This will lighten up the screen for better picture taking. Under normal circumstances, you will not need a flash even inside your home! This will greatly improve your all around camera quality!! Hope it helps!! Great phone!\n",

      "This is a great phone for those of us who want a VERY nice, large screen, excellent battery life and don't need the fastest phone on the market. Yeah, it's slower than the Sammie S6 I got from work, but it isn't a long, painful wait for it to complete a task, just a slight hesitation. Unless you are a serious power user I doubt you'll have a problem with performance. The battery life is better than the S6. And it works as well as the Samsung as an actual phone (yes, I actually make calls on my phone... I'm old).The rear camera is fine... far better than my photography, that's for sure. I don't do selfies, so I don't know how well the front camera works (as indicated above, I'm old).The sound is MUCH better than the Samsung, both from the speaker and headphones, and the music program is easy to use and plays FLAC files.It is light enough that even with an armored case it isn't too heavy, and I quickly got used to the size. It is easier to carry on my belt, but it fits in my pocket. The S6 seems too small to me now, and I will almost certainly get another 5.5\" phone next time..I would have no hesitation buying another Alcatel phone when this one is ready to retire in another year or two. Or maybe three if it keeps working, since it certainly is meeting my phone, e-mail, snapshot and web surfing needs very well.\n",

      "Decent phone, shame it died one day after the one year warranty ended. It was while I was playing kingdom hearts unchained x. Symptoms were: phone got hot, touch screen became unresponsive on and off, the next day blue screen, rebooted, another blue screen, then phone completely died.Dual front facing speakers that get nice and loud so that's a huge plus, mine came with jbl earbuds which is awesome considering how most phones don't even include them anymore. But, the placement of the auxiliary port is located at the top of the phone and this is weird because the mini usb port is located on the bottom. If you used one of those magnetic air vent phone holders for you car, things will get messy as there's no clear orientation to have good cable management when you want to plug the auxiliary cable to your phone while charging. However, the reversible design is nice so that you can make the auxiliary cable be located on the bottom relatively by putting the phone upside down.Coming from a samsung galaxy s3, the idol 3's screen is much more vibrant. Also the phone is about 7mm thin which is just 1mm thicker than the thinnest phone out there. Also you should plan on getting a case for the phone, the back of this phone is really slippery with zero grip which is awful for such a thin phone. So if you get sweaty hands due to the heat emitted from this phone, the chance of it falling is quite high. Another plus was that alcatel did provide a software update to Android Marshmallow, which no one thought they would do considering the idol 4 was coming out, the idol 3 was made by a chinese company which don't really provide software support, and that the idol 3 was a budget phone. The stock os doesn't really come with a lot of bloat, although surprisingly, the clock app that comes with the phone is actually made by avg, the same guys that make the antivirus, which no one would have found out until one day play store decided to update the clock app. The updated clock app was terrible because it went away from the google's material design to some awkward interface. The average rating was around 2 stars before avg reverted back to the original clock app. The biggest con I would have to mention is the very slow flash storage, this is really noticeable when you load files or install apps in the play store.Oh well, time to get a new phone and this is just a lesson to always back up your texts and photos as well as get an extended warranty if you plan on using the phone for a very long time. Especially on devices like these where there is no removable back cover. I set the expected usage to a year anyways when I bought the phone considering it was only 250 when I bought it. The phone did get cheaper, but that's to be expected as time goes on.-----update 9/13/16---------Wow, so they still honored the warranty when my phone died. Fantastic service; they went above and beyond. They shipped the phone back with 2 day ups air too.\n",

      "I have had the phone for a week now and here is my honest opinion. As you see, that I have given the phone 5 stars. This rating is for comparison to other phones in it's price range. I am not going to try and compare this phone with IPhone or Samsung. I have T-Mobile and I am on a no-contract employee plan that requires me to buy my phones outright. So price is a BIG deal. IMO the phone is great! Here are my honest thoughts:- Screen Size and looks is great! Very readable in the sun. Well above it's $250 price tag- The ONLY lag I ever experience is when I am sweeping running apps. And that is hardly a lag. It is very fluid and responsive.- No Dropped Calls- My LTE T-Mobile data has been 12.5 mbps- Front facings speakers are amazing and sound great. BUT they are louder than I want them to be at the lowest setting. I have Triplets Babies and when they are asleep, I can't have headphones in and the audio on the lowest setting is still too loud.- The Camera is Great! No issues or complaints.- The double tap to turn it on is unreliable and works less than 50% of the time. Double tapping to turn off works just fine.- BUT I am right handed and I have no issues with where the on/off button is. I don't know why others have complained.- I love the I can talk into either end of the phone. Especially when using the google search. It hears me every time!- The GPS is great and on-time! The front facing speakers were great to hear the turn by turn directions.- The head phones sound great!- The reversible setting is awesome and such a duh idea.- This may be an Android problem but is really annoying… but any group messaging that I have gets a date of Jan 17, 1970 and so they just sit at the bottom of my messages log. It’s VERY Annoying and I can’t figure out how to fix that. Anyone else have this problem?- Battery Life is about a day in a half. I use my phone mostly with Calls, Texts, Twitter, Facebook, Email, Camera, Internet. (Occasionally the GPS and Netflix, no gaming.)- In all, the phone is not \"perfect\". But just as close as it's going to be at this price. Definitely worth 5 stars and I recommend it every time!Now I just need a case. Not a bulky one. Any recommendations?\n",

No more fumbling for your Phone, it has a lag to it when your performing some task (mainly task manager), but its ok. Good battery life (for the screen size), I get a whole day out of a charge. I really love the phone, especially because I've always bought unlocked phones but this one does it all at a fraction of the cost!!!! Highly recommended. Get tons of compliments on the look and sound quality......Sad to say I took the case off the phone to swap out my sd card and dropped the phone and wouldn't you know it, the screen cracked in the upper right corner. now the touch is inconsistent making the phone useless.

      "I've had this phone for a week and must say it lives up to the hype. A great midrange phone for budget price. $250 is a steal and I envy you who got the $199 deal.If you know this phone exists then you've most likely already seen reviews, you already know the good. You're here because you want to know what's bad right?ConsButton Placement - Its like this phone is made for lefties, I don't know what Alcatel was thinking when they inserted the power button WAYYY to the top left. You'll try to substitute with double tap to wake but it only works .75 of the time and you'll find it better to simply click the power button. The up/down volume buttons is something it will take a LONG TIME getting use to. I'm so used to the volume buttons being on the mid-left instead of top right... What were they thinking!? LolConnection - When I first got the phone it seemed to drop connection a bit, I'd say 1/5 calls. I was kinda pissed at first BUT the past 3 days it hasn't dropped any and I make lots of phone calls since I'm a supervisor and have a lot of unreliable employees. Also I live in Miami not like in the middle of no where so I have good reception.Camera - If you're coming from a high end device this rear facing camera won't impress you. Coming from a 8MP Galaxy S3 I'd say this camera JUST gets the job done. This camera is pretty bad at catching light if you take a picture at 12PM it looks like it was taken 6PM. Take it at 7PM it looks like it was taken 11PM. If you post 10 pictures on IG & FB everyday you'll probably want to aim for something with a better camera.Not trying to poop on the camera because like I said it gets the job done.In contrast the 8MP front facing camera is great. One of the few phones on the market with something above a 5MP front facing camera.Those are the only small negatives I can think of BUT its not really deal breaking which is why I still gave it 5 stars. If you're on the fence just click purchase you won't regret it. If so simply return it within 30 days. 😄\n",

Was worried that the 5.5\" screen would feel too big in my hand, but it actually fits well in my hand.

      "I've had a N5 since launch. The N5 was a great phone for me other than the horrendous battery life. Fast forward to the present and I wanted even more screen real estate. I knew I wanted at least 5.5\", maybe even 6\". I just couldn't justify spending north of $400+ for a N6, G4, S6, etc though. When the Idol went for sale for $180 on Amazon Prime Day I had to take the chance even though this phone was completely off my radar. The Idol 3 makes the Nexus 5 feel/look like old newsIdol 3 as compared to the Nexus 5:**Screen**The screen is just as good as the N5, I'd say even better as there isn't horrendous white light bleed along the edge at extreme viewing angels. The extra half inch really makes a difference in media consumption.**Battery**Oh wow! It's nice to have a battery again!I had a QI wireless charger for my N5 at work. Probably a good thing too or I would have sold my N5 a long time ago as we all know the battery blows on the N5. While I'd prefer that the Idol had wireless charging ability, I can live without it as I can easily get 2 days of use. It's so odd looking at the battery percentage and not see it drop like a rock during the day. I need to look into aftermarket wireless micro usb charger + case to conceal it. Hopefully I can find the thinnest most \"stock\" looking combo.**Speakers**The speakers? OMFGBBQ!!! I sometimes listened to the N5 streaming music on it's lone speaker when working on projects. It provided fill and it passed the time. The Idol's speakers are exponentially better. Heck I don't even think I've had them over 3/4 volume. I don't think I can buy another phone that DOESN'T have two forward facing speakers now. I'm spoiled now.**Performance**Feels on par with my N5. Yeah I see a stutter here and there when loading a page or what not but it's in no way a deal breaker for me.**Reception**I'm on TMO's $30 5gb prepaid plan and I get crap for cellular reception in my house. Luckily I get LTE @ my work. So I've completely converted to Google Hangouts VOIP. I use wifi @ home for calls, LTE data while I'm away from the house. After a week things have been great so far for my coverage and use.**Feel**Lighter, thinner than the N5. Only con is the Idol is a slippery sob! I really have to mind my Ps and Qs when handling it. I like my phones to be naked as I don't like the bulk. However I think I'll have to just bite the bullet and get a case for this, not only for the wireless charging listed above, but for grip as well as protection cause yeah I don't think the Idol is gonna take well to abuse :(**Conclusion**Well I was able to sell my N5 for $180 on CL in a day. Since I basically stole the Idol for $180 from that Amazon sale I got a GREAT upgrade for free :) I'm a happy camper.Now that the boot-loader is unlocked on the Idol I'm anxiously awaiting how performance will increase with a custom rom.

      "This is the cheapest phone I've ever bought and one of the best I've ever had. Having used it constantly everyday for almost a month now I knew I had to review it.Let's start with the physical: The phone is thin with a sleek design comparable to some flagships out there. It is ultra lightweight to the point that I don't feel it in my purse; sometimes I actually rummage through my bag to make sure it's still there. The screen is big and pictures are clear and crisp. Same sound-wise, I haven't had any dropped calls or had people on the other end telling me they can't hear me so it's definitely a jump up from my last android which was more than double the price.Now the technical: To start with I purchased a 32gb SDHC card to take advantage of the expandable storage so I didn't have to skimp out on any apps I used, and as a long time T-Mobile customer I was able to get the SIM card for free. I immediately put the cards in and voila I had a working phone. [Disclaimer: There are no features from T-Mobile that I do not have access to, unless there are features out there that I am not aware of].So the important stuff, I am in love with the eye scanner (HOW COOL IS THAT) which can be used as a lock screen mechanism. It makes me feel like a secret spy agent! Unlike fingerprint readers which seem outdated now, I'm able to impress my friends and family with an eye scanner. I also very much enjoy the camera which pulls up with two presses of the power button, it beats tapping on a screen that isn't always responsive in a moment's notice. I can capture vital images quickly and accurately in a moving vehicle or when I'm at a concert, which is simply awesome especially for the price tag. Lastly, the fast charging nature of this phone puts me in awe. I use the phone for hours on end and yes the battery drains like a normal phone does, but then all I have to do is plug it in and my phone gets charged in no time! I can also keep playing my games, video chatting and having multiple apps and webpages open with no lag and without pausing to let the phone charge, and a regular car charger gets my phone charged even when I have Waze or Google Maps on.Overall I highly recommend this phone, if it somehow died I would buy another one without hesitation. This phone is comparable to flagships in terms of design and basic features one looks for in a phone. And for the price it truly is unbeatable without being inferior.\n",

      "I've had this phone for about a month & I have nothing but good thing to say about it. Here's what I think after one month:PRO- Inexpensive, loud stereo speakers, some nifty & unique features, good (day) camera & very slim profile and not to mention very light- Good battery: the battery should last a day even with heavy use. I'm not a heavy user and mine actually lasted one & half day with single charge.- Bright large 5.5\" full HD (1080P) screen.- Unlocked, no contract and no preloaded garbage apps- Able to add more memory up to 128 GB using microSD card.CONS- Handling: This is a big phone so the combination of size, thinness and low weight will be an issue for small hands.- Performance is somewhat sluggish when compared to my older phones such as LG G3, Note 3 and my Fire phone.- Low light photography - Indoor & @ night, must use flash.- Battery is not replaceable.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -This is my second Alcatel phone. After my first one which was returned promptly I vowed not to buy another but after reading the reviews & partly because of Amazon one day special sale (got it for $199) I gave it a try. And now, I think this phone is worth every penny. This is by far the best phone Alcatel has made. They were able to put some mid to premium features into this phone and sell at a very low budget price.DESIGN & BUILTThis phone is very elegent. It got rounded edges framing a metalic like body. The screen sits slightly over the JBL speakers on top and bottom which makes the overall look very unique. The back camera takes great outdoor photos during the day but at night you'll need to use flash.SPECIAL FEATURES- Reversible interface - Phone has speakers and microphone on top and bottom and once you activate the feature, it doesn't matter which side you hold up to make or receive calls. I've never seen this feature on any other phone before.- Double-tap lock screen feature - They copied this from LG G series phones. The implementation of it though is somewhat sluggish. You have to tap it a few times before the screen turns on or off.CAMERA- IDOL3 has a 13-megapixel auto-focus rear camera, and an above average 8-megapixel front-facing for selfies. The lens is flush to the back, so there’s no raised section like the new iPhone or Galaxy S6 and others. On the software side, the layout is simple but it does come with a variety of shooting modes and interestingly there is also a manual mode with shutter speed control. The camera delivers decent looking photos in moderately lit conditions with nice details and saturated colors. However, it seems to struggle with low lit situation and with no flash, you get hazy details with some noticeable noise. But on the plus side, it does have electronic image stabilization feature which helps to keep things steady especially when you're working with the manual mode with low shutter speed. Also the latest OTA update has significantly improved the camera's performance. Colors look nicer, it focus better and snaps photos faster. If you get this phone be sure to get the latest OTA update.BATTERY PEFORMANCEThe 2910 mAH last me the full day and even after 24 hours I still had 30% left and so this is one big plus for this phone.Overall I highly recommend this phone. There are very few phones that can match the features with such a low price. Oneplus one (last year version) which is now readily available is the one of only two true competitor. That phone is faster but its 64 GB version is $75 more and with IDOL 3 you can add up to 128 GB of SD so from that standpoint its ahead. The other phone is Zenfone 2 which is $50 more but from what I read, there's a lot of shortcoming with that phone. Anyway, if you're looking for a feature rich, low price, no contract phone, you can't go wrong with IDOL 3.\n"

      "For the price, the only device that can compare to this for the price is the zenfone 2. The zf2 has a more powerful processor, GPU and 2x the ram for $50 more. Even though I'm usually all about specifications on my devices, I don't play graphically intense games on my phone. (that's what a PC or console is for in my opinion) So I'll take the better screen, slimmer profile, almost completely stock version of Android and the dual JBL audio front facing speakers any day over the slight difference in performance.I've seen some reviews of people receiving units with a few annoying problems but I'm assuming those are either factory defects or refurbished units because I've had nothing but good experiences so far with mine.If I had to find something negative to say about this phone, I'd say the power button placement doesn't make sense at all even for a lefty. But the factory software does allow for double tap to wake and the display does rotate 180° in portrait which takes care of the button placement for the most part. The second thing is that I've noticed a few stutters here and there, and considering I came from a note 3 with the SD800, these slight stutters happen so infrequently that it doesn't bother me and I didn't really pay attention to them till I read about it in some reviews. Either way, I'm pretty sure this is because of the software optimization because other SD615 devices run smother. Hopefully an update to 5.1 or even marshmallow will cure this. If not, bootloader is already unlocked, root is her and there's already twrp available. Custom ROMs should be available soon too.\n",

      "I read Amazon reviews on this product, and determined that the Alcatel ONETOUCH IDOL 3 would fit my needs perfectly due to the product specifications and price point. I could not be more wrong. I have switched brands of cell phones over the years, varying from Apple, LG, Motorola RAZR, Nokia, and even Cingular phones. Nothing I have used in the last ten years has been as fragile and poorly made as this one. While reaching into my pocket to read a text message I just received, I went to swipe my phone to unlock. However, the glass surface (digitizer) of the phone would not recognize my swipes, and started trying to swipe all on its own. I thought this was bizarre, and upon closer inspection there were some small cracks on the top left corner of the phone. After trying to swipe further, the crack spread all the way from the top left to the center right of the digitizer, effectively making the phone useless. Since this was in my pocket previously, I have no idea how it cracked, since it was working fine and had no issues throughout the day. It is utterly pathetic that this product broke INSIDE my pocket, and their customer service team has been even worse in terms of honoring any warranty or protection from this brittle, cheaply-made phone. I would recommend any other smartphone instead of this one, because it is not acceptable in 2015 to have phones so fragile you must bubble wrap them before storage.Summary: If you are looking for an unlocked phone, go with another brand, because it will actually work and not break inside your pocket within two months of purchase. Just go here (http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/wireless/2407749011/ref=s9_acsd_ri_bw_clnk?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-5&pf_rd_r=0MPS87YSGRVP9GKHPS5D&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=2153843082&pf_rd_i=2407749011_p0_h) and make sure whatever you do, never, EVER get an Alcatel ONETOUCH Idol 3.\n",

      "I wanted to give the phone 5 stars...but some worries keep me from it. The good stuff is outstanding, and what little bad stuff there is is easy to overcome. It's an amazing phone for a great price point. Except...(I'll get to that in a minute).PROS:--Great screen and visibility. Even in bright sunlight and from different angles, the screen is sharp and easy to see. I purchased a tempered glass screen protector, but that might be overkill.--The internal radios are fine. I have no trouble picking up AT&T LTE signals.--Super stereo effect from the twin JBL speakers with good volume when listening in speaker mode.--Great form factor. Though the phone is big, it's very slim and fits the hand easily, and it looks great. I bought a sturdy case in part to keep the screen from contacting tabletops and to give it a little extra \"grip,\" though.--For basic day-to-day use, the battery is amazing. With ordinary call activity and web surfing, I can get 2+ days easily.--The flip feature, letting you use the phone easily right side up or upside down is really cool.--While some complain about the placement of the power button high on the left edge, I like it. I tend to use the phone in my left hand, so that works well for me.--It's (almost) pure Android, so very intuitive.--The cameras produce excellent photos in decent light...but...MINOR CONS:--As others have noted, the pix are noisy in less-than-ideal lighting. The preloaded camera app is awkward to use, but I simply added Open Camera (free on Google Play).--Several of the other pre-loaded apps are weak to worthless, but easy enough to ignore.--For as good as the speakers are in speakerphone mode, they sound rather tinny in standard mode.MAJOR CON:--Here's what has me worried. This baby gets REALLY hot really quickly when watching videos or playing games. I'm concerned that over time, that will be a huge issue for battery longevity. I'm not a big gamer or video watcher, but if you are, you'd be well served looking for something else.\n",

Double tap on and off decides on its own when it wants to work, I hit call button twice sometimes because it doesn't respond the first time I try and the swype to text on the phone doesn't work well; it's as if my finger gets caught up/stuck on the screen and it doesn't make the word or forms incorrect word.Its just too slow and unresponsive for me. When I clear the screens with button on bottom right, the slowness shows as the framerate is horribly choppy. Plus the battery is built in.

      "Ok so a lot of people have the following needs for a phone: using email, web browsing, listening to music, texting/making calls, casual game playing. A lot of those people buy $700 phones to just meet those needs. The alcatel idol 3 is a fraction of that cost without any compromises in those areas. It looks feels and sounds like a classy flagship. It doesnt have the tech horse power of a 700 dollar phone, meaning if you do a lot of multitasking and high-end gaming then this probably isnt your best choice. But iv seen a lot of people mention minor lag and i can say: in terms of basic normal use there is no lag what so ever. If youre looking for something that can dazzle on a budget for the average user, this will deliver. I do wonder about the durability in the long run. The screen sits on top of the device in a way that makes me think its probably not the hardest thing to break.

      "I won't rehash what's already been said about this phone. Overall I think it's a good package for the price. Three problems I have which may warrant its return are the fact that I can't get a LTE Signal on StraightTalk (AT&T Network - could be SIM card related; still investigating), can't get it to pair with my 2012 Ford F-150 Sync System (non-touch screen version) and can't get the swipe function on the keyboard to work. A vivid, bright screen, decent speakers and low price can't make up for basic functionality I rely on everyday.

I do find the Idol 3 to have more lag than my Nexus 4, which was running KitKat, not Lollipop.Update: Turned out that the Bluetooth pairing problem was on the Sync end. Following a master reset of Sync the phone paired effortlessly for both phone and media audio. Haven't tried text to speech yet though. I downloaded the Google Keyboard app and swipe function has been restored. Apparently it is a well documented issue that the stock keyboard app doesn't support swipe gestures. I've upped the review to 4-stars. A little more processing performance & less lag would garner a 5 star rating.\n",

I am using map my run to record my runs and the phone just turned off and this happened all the time I use it to record my workout. The good thing about this phone is probably the camera and the charge. It hold the charge pretty good, with all the apps on it and video call,I manage to stay away from the charger for 2 full days. I kept it for a week now but i am returning it.Just to update my rating, so i live in an apt on 10th floor and I can't get a fair signal, when outside I get the 4G LTE signal ,then at my work I get H+ what ever that is and of course I have no service in the basement. From different places, the signal jump and the Bluetooth is on and off in my car and sometimes I am on the phone and all is just blank, nothing I can still see the signal strength either H+ or 4G LTE.I default storage for picture and video to SD card and that is not working, I have to manually do that and clear the phone memory which is already used with all the apps.

The audio is amazing its up there with the HTC one m8 in my opinion. Only complaint I have is that the original one I recieveced had very nice jbl headphones, and the second one had much cheaper headphones. That doesn't concern the phone but that was quite the disappointment. Had the phone for several months now and I still hold it in the highest regard. Blows the HTC one I had before this, out of the water in every way. And now its 30$ cheaper then when I got it. Even more of a steal.\n",

      "Alcatel Onetouch Idol 3 5.5 has certainly done right this time. The phone can't compete with the top flagship phones today, but for its price, you can't really complain. Phone is nicely designed and it is almost as thin as a iphone 6+. Phone has a beautiful display and loud speakers that you can compete with the flagship phones today. That's where the difference ends. It has a slower snapdragon 615 cpu 2gigs of memory, no removable battery, nfc and wireless/quick charge. One design quirk that I don't like is the placement of the power and volume rocker. Most phones has power button to the right and volume rockers to the left, this is just the opposite. Not to mention that the power button is so high up in the phone. The phone looks nice but not very well protected so you should definitely get a case for it. Software is Lollipop 5.0.2 rather than 5.1.1 that other flagship offers. Although I can't complain about the almost stock android experience which works fine for me. You definitely need a micro sd card if you want to put movies and mp3's as I only have 7 gigs free without having any media files stored internally. I hope that Alcatel can offer software updates like what the other flagship phones does.Should you get this phone, yes, but I would wait for Alcatel phone goes on sale as I brought mine for less than $200.Pro's- Has a beautiful 1080p display.- Very nice stereo speakers- FM tuner- Band 12 LTE for t-mobile phones- Nice, nice and thin design while maintaining a 2915 mah battery.Cons- Placement of power and volume rockers- Slower Snapdragon 615 cpu with 2 gigs of memory.- No NFC, wireless and quick charging- Android 5.0.2 rather than 5.1.1\n",

      "Coming from a nexus 5, this was definitely a good upgrade. The screen is just amazing, the best screen I've seen on a phone. It's vibrant and bright (even in bright sunlight). I really hope the next version has more RAM and a better camera. The current camera is good but nothing to write home about. It's definitely better than the nexus 5 (2013) and the moto g and it's not fair to compare it to flagship phones. The speakers are ridiculously good (stereo too!!). It comes with JBL headsets, which are way better than the other standard headsets you get these days (if you're lucky to get one that is). The screen size is great. The next model should definitely have quick charge, a bigger battery (even though the current one lasts almost 12 hours on medium-high use and at 70% brightness, this includes watching videos, listening to music a lot and reading articles every hour). The SD card is a huge advantage, seriously this phone is a winner. Also, the most important part, it's pretty much stock Android!!! Which is really the star of the show here.

Easily the best sound I've ever heard from a phone. While it's not loud enough for a large party, it is great for at home listening.Camera: 13MP camera takes good pictures. Low light is not excellent but, again, for the price, very nice.Expandable memory: Has a double slot for Sim and micro SD card. Even my Moto X didn't do that.Battery: Makes it through the whole day with moderately heavy use. You can kill it if you try hard enough but I usually have half a charge left after a long day.Minuses: There appears to be no way to stop \"full battery\" notifications. If you have it by your bed at night, it is annoying to be notified of a full battery at 3AM.Speed: While adequate, there is some lag with multiple applications open. To me, just mildly irritating but this might be a deal breaker for power users.\n",

      "Great phone, great price. I shopped around for a budget-priced phone with up to date specs. I spent days on this, and decided on this phone because it was $100 less than I was willing to spend but it still had everything I needed. My only concern at purchase was I thought battery life would be an issue coming off a phone with a 5000 MaH battery I had with the BLU Studio Energy 2. What I do is go into settings and turn on battery saver immediately after taking the phone off the charger. That way I get about 18 hours of fairly active use, calling, texting, streaming video, listening to audio. Then I put on charger and am ready for the next day. It has a 2950 MaH battery but lasts more like a 4000 MaH one on battery saver mode. Phone is super fast with octa-core processor, even running on battery saver - I can't really tell the difference in performance, but it's limiting the background processes that drain the juice out of most phones. Phone ships with Android 5.1, but it quickly upgrades to the newer Android Marshmallow 6.0 software upon initial bootup. Also, phone has an 8MP selfie camera, 5MP is standard on many phones which is ice. The front camera is decent at 13MP, on par with a Samsung S6. Nice display and beautiful video. At 5.5\" it's the right size and the build quality is impressive. Good sound from the JBL twin speakers, you can actually hear. Call quality seems to be good (I'm on Cricket), and the speakerphone comes in loud and clear. It even comes with NFC built-in if that's important to you. Overall, it's a 5-star phone at a 3-star price point and it has my highest recommendation.\n",

With that being said I literally stumbled upon the Idol 3 pre-order page and said what the heck. 199.99 what could I lose. Well last week when I received it I was stunned by what I got. This phone specs may not be jaw dropping but the way it's all put together is amazing. The signal reception is great. The camera is great. The app load times is great.

      "Update December 30th, 2015:* I had to downgrade my rating to a 3 star because after 6 months of usage the phone is noticeably showing wear and tear of being a cheap phone. I had no illusion that the phone would be masterfully constructed at the price point. At this point I can feel that the phone creaks if bent a little bit, and I can see that my screen cover's glue has come off at one edge. To top this off the camera has failed me recently, and I'm in the process of submitting a warranty claim. If that goes well and this are better, then I'll consider bumping the star rating back up to 4 stars....Original Review follows, and all of these things are still true for me. I do really love what this phone got right, its just too bad its not constructed better...Here are a few thing that should make you want this phone:* The Camera app - Alcatel seems to have made their own camera app, and do not use the Android stock app (which if you want you could install from the app store). But this app I feel like is superior to the android one. It does virtually no hunting for focus, and takes photos immediately when you press the shutter button. I feel like this gives the camera a distinctly Apple Iphone feel to it, and have been pleasantly surprised. The Google Camera app does not function as smoothly, and am glad to have an alternative with the Alcatel. Others have commented on the actual camera photo quality itself, which I have not tested, but honestly for my use I'm glad that the app just functions fast.* The phone is pretty much stock android. I put the Google Now Launcher on my phone and the experience is almost exactly the same as my old Nexus 4. There are a few pre-loaded apps, but you can easily remove them. The ones that you can't remove are system apps like the android gallery, and the Mix application which is a music player. Both can be ignored for your applications of choice.With that said, other reviews have done a good job of describing the phone and its pros and cons. I just wanted to add the only reason I can't give it a 5, is that while it is awesome for the price, it still has its drawbacks. It does so many things great, and they got many features totally right. But after using it for 4 or 5 days, I begin to notice the areas where they had to cut corners to get it to the price it is at. These things have been mentioned in other reviews already. With that said. Its amazing how much they do for the price, but they haven't quite hidden the reasons you might want a more expensive phone, in my opinion. If you're already in the market for spending this much, instead of buying something much more expensive, then I can say you should definitely just buy it and try it out.\n",

      "I moved from a Note II (T-Mobile) to this Idol 3. I got tired of carrying around a phone that had extra weight and size due to a stylus I never used. I got in on the original pre-order price of $200 and decided to give it a try. I have had the phone a little over a week and would like to run down some of my thoughts.- I like the screen, it is clear and bright and I don’t find myself missing my AMOLED from my Note II.- The screen is very visible in direct sunlight, way better than my Note II, wife’s S3 or G2.- I do not mind the left side power button (I’m left handed) but it takes some getting used to.- Regarding the above I am aware the phone has a double tap to wake/sleep function however I have found it very inconsistent. My wife’s G2 is much more consistent, I would say hers works 95% of the time and this about 50% (to wake, to sleep is much more consistent). I sent an email to Alcatel and they claim they are aware of this issue and plan on addressing it in an update.- It is very light and easy to use with my “medium” sized guy hands.- Case selection is somewhat limited.- It works well with T-Mobile, I get LTE where I did with my Note II and have no issue with wifi, Bluetooth or GPS. I do miss the stock T-Mobile voicemail app (the play store one is buggy).- The camera is quick to focus and takes pretty good photos. Video is good as well. I consider it as good as the one I had on my Note II (I liked that camera).- I like that it is not cluttered with bloat wear. My T-Mobile branded phone was loaded with all kinds of app’s I could not remove. I think this lends to the phone’s efficient use of resources.- Battery life has been good so far, I get through a day. I am a bit apprehensive about the lack of a replaceable battery. I always like the idea of being able to replace/swap mine on my Note II.6/12/15 Update -- The lowest setting for volume for the notifications is way to loud. There are plenty of apps to \"boost\" volume but I can not find a good one for a work around here.- I have not been get 5ish hours of screen on time as many reviewers state. I usually get to about 4 with about 10% battery left. I am not a heavy gamer. Just email, reading web pages and texting. A smattering of clash of clans here and there.\n",

      "I purchased this phone only recently here on Amazon and paid $99 - but it is now listed @ $240. And so you might think I would be delighted that I got such a 'good' deal, right? WRONG. I am extremely disappointed with this phone, despite my previous research and finding many good reviews on it.I have an LG41C with no special bells and whistles, though it pretty much has everything I really need. But after almost two years, it's got a couple of glitches that can't be resolved so I thought I would \"upgrade\" to another brand and a larger size. What a mistake!This Alcatel takes 45 + seconds to start fully (my LG takes 20), it takes only adequate photos (my LG takes GREAT pics), the battery runs almost out after only a few hours of little to no usage and with power save on - plus I haven't even talked on this phone yet! (my LG runs hours longer and I occasionally talk on it), and this Alcatel takes HOURS to fully charge (my LG takes an hour at most and that's if it's under 10%). AND while it's charging (power off) it makes a low buzzing sound about every 15 seconds and there is NO way to stop it.In addtion to all that - I cannot open photos on messaging and despite confirming that all the settings are correct. I tried everything possible and then called Alcatel and was actually told that the messaging that is built into this phone is not the best and you can't receive MMS! What? My LG has always opened photos via its built-in messaging, as long as mobile data is enabled. So the Alcatel rep told me to use another messaging app in order to open photos. Unacceptable.And not only all that, it will NOT sound a notification upon receipt of text messages. Again, I have worked with all the appropriate settings (I'm not a novice) over and over and it simply will not work.Also, there are no emojis available on the keypad when you're using Instagram. Huh?I've no doubt there are multiple other problems with this phone that I've never even encountered yet - but in the two weeks that I've used it, these are quite enough problems.And now . . . this is the worst:In the past couple of days, this Alcatel gets VERY HOT during charging (my LG NEVER gets hot when charging, not even in the slightest) - and this heating issue alone is why I am going to send it back because I fear it is potentially dangerous. A phone simply should NOT get this hot while charging.Everyone has their own opinion and can make their own decision - but I would NOT recommend this phone to anyone and I am appalled that this $99 phone (not even worth that) is NOW listed at such a ridiculous price of $240.\n",

They are also both huge gamers when allowed and this phone keeps up with them! The screen is beautiful and the sound is incredible. My daughter is a music lover so she's always streaming music from hers and I can hear it from all over the house when she has it turned up - with her door closed. I love that this phone offers everything a high end phone does for a fraction of the price. My husband actually is thinking of getting rid of his current phone to get one of these and he's a phone nerd. It comes with the phone, wall plug in and cable and some very nice jbl headphones that sound amazing! Cases and screen protectors are not hard to find for this phone which is nice.

The display is very amazing as well.My idol 3 5.5' is extremely good when playing videos. I love watching movie trailers and YouTube videos on it.My standard of choosing smartphones:1. At least 2GB RAM, CPU really doesn't matter to me2. 1080p or higher display resolution3. Display is larger than 5.0 inches4. Dual frontal stereo speakers5. Good product quality6. At least a 3000mAh bettary7. Expandable storage or a 64GB storage with a reasonable price8. Quick charger availableWhat I don't like about my idol 3:1. The JBL earbuds are those deep in-ear type which I don't like at all. It feels very uncomfortable to me to put anything deep inside of my ears. I know those deep in-ear headphones are very popular right now, but I really don't like them. This is not a big issue since I have earbuds from Apple and Motorola and I usually use my AKG and Sony headbands to listen to music.2. There is a lag sometimes while using the phone. This is not a big problem except when playing music which really bothers me. I hope it is a software issue, but I didn't have that problem with my Moto X 2 Gen.Considering the price, idol 3 5.5' really is a very good choice!\n",

      "If you get this phone, be very very careful with it.I purchased this phone right when it came out in the U.S., pre-ordering it on Amazon. Overall, I found it to be a great deal. The screen and battery life were great, the processor snappy, and the camera good for the price range.Unfortunately, after 6 months, I pulled my Alcatel Idol 3 out of my pocket and the screen was cracked. It had not been struck by anything, as you can see from the photo below. The crack comes from the edge, and there is no physical damage there. When I called Alcatel and they told me the warranty does not cover 'physical damage' and that a cracked screen counts as 'physical damage' no matter what.Maybe my phone was defective an Alcatel simply didn't want to cover my warranty. Otherwise, I gotta say, ONLY BUY THIS PHONE IF YOU PLAN TO BE VERY GENTLE WITH IT!!! (I had mine in a protective case).I ended up with a Moto G 3. It isn't quite as good as the Alcatel Idol 3 as far as screen goes, but what is the use of a phone that is slightly better if it is liable to break and Alcatel won't cover it? It is not worth the $200+ dollar risk.Again, hopefully for others, my phone was just defective.\n",

      "Let me first list the best things about this phone:- Excellent speakers and superb screen, it is a joy to watch music videos and movies on this phone- Lot of value for the money- Thin, really good looking phoneThe bad/not so good points:- Way too slippery and without gorilla glass I am sure my screen would have shattered with regular use, ended up buying a wallet case and now I have a bulky phone- Not the best processing power, I face occasional lags especially after Marshmallow update. I wouldn't have mentioned this as a negative point considering the phone price point but I have a Blu phone that cost less than this phone and that phone is much faster.In short if you are looking for a phone with good stereo speakers and nice display but don't mind putting a screen protector and a bulky case for the phone, this would be a good fit. But if you are looking to use the phone without any protective case then this may not be the right phone since I am pretty sure the phone screen will break with regular use.\n",

      "I've had this phone for a couple of days now; I wanted something with a bigger screen, but without having to spend the eight or nine hundred bucks it would have cost to stay in the iPhone family. My overall cost for this phone and a 64 GB microSD card was about 1/4 the cost of an iPhone 6S Plus.Getting the phone set up was mostly simple—I checked for and installed the Android system updates while charging the phone, then put in the microSD and SIM cards. (The SIM card was kind of a pain, since an adapter was necessary, but once I discovered that the adapter I ordered did include a thin strip of tape to make sure the SIM card doesn't fall out (which was not mentioned anywhere on the package), all went smoothly.)The parts I like, so far:• the expandable storage/memory. I may replace the 64 GB card with a 128 GB card at some point, but it'll be more than enough for now. I'm just happy to no longer be limited to the phone's built-in storage.• the large screen and full HD (1080 x 1920) resolution. Text is very readable, even at the \"normal\" setting, and there's plenty of room for whatever I'm looking at. Images generally look sharp and smooth, without jagginess.• the \"double tap\" feature. Double tap to wake the phone, then double tap to put it to sleep again. Very convenient—especially given the phone's reversible feature. Caveat: it does not work with the lock screen. In that instance, the power button has to be used to put the phone back to sleep.• the reversible feature. I'm surprised more phones don't do this. When the feature is enabled, the display orients itself to the way you are holding the phone. Not only that, but the earpiece and microphones switch as well, so the phone is always right side up, even when holding it upside down.• the battery life. So far, the battery life seems very good. The phone did charge a little bit between the time I transferred some photos to my computer and the time I unplugged the USB cable; otherwise, the battery is currently at 39% since its first full charge two nights ago.• the \"sweep\" feature (or whatever it is called), which enables you to close all open apps at once. Very convenient.• the phone is light. Despite being significantly larger than my old iPhone 5 (the display on this phone by itself is bigger than the iPhone 5 in a case), the Idol 3 is lighter than the iPhone 5. I don't think it's a huge difference, but it's definitely enough to notice.• the stereo speakers. The speakers sound good—and they sound just as good whether the phone is facing up or down (even in the simple case I bought for it).• the unlocked phone is upgradable to Marshmallow 6.0.1. (My carrier offers the Idol 3, but there's no indication of the Marshmallow upgrade being available from them anytime soon. Otherwise, I would have gone through them.)There are a couple of things I'm not so keen on at the moment:• the placement of the buttons. Though on opposite sides, the power and volume buttons are placed at about the same level; I have already taken several inadvertent screenshots while trying to put the phone to sleep from the lock screen.• the camera. It may be a matter of getting used to it, but the camera does not appear to live up to the quality of the display. Colors seem a bit washed out, especially with the front camera. Also, the front camera offers only automatic exposure, whereas the back camera offers full manual. UPDATE (8/20/16): The manual mode is useless. You can adjust ISO, shutter speed, and focus (!), but all you'll get is a black image—yup, no picture whatsoever. Only the automatic exposure mode will work. In addition, the panoramic mode does a poor job; you WILL end up with jagged edges at the least, and probably even sections where the image is not stitched together properly. In any event, in all but the best lighting conditions, your images will be noisy, with some blockiness apparent, and plenty of chroma noise. If you already have a phone that takes decent photos, you'll want to hang onto it; either that, or use a real camera.• if you use a PIN to unlock your phone, Android requires you to press a \"check\" key after the number. Not a huge deal, but iOS unlocks the phone as soon as you've pressed that last digit, so I sometimes forget, and the phone goes back to sleep.• unlike the iPhone, this phone doesn't read the SIM card until after the rather lengthy splash screen animation has finished. So, whereas the iPhone will show the name of the carrier and signal strength as soon as you've unlocked the phone, the Idol 3 shows \"No SIM Card\", and then \"No SIM Card – [carrier]\" before the name of the carrier appears. This always gives me pause, particularly since I have a nano SIM and had to use an adapter. Also unlike the iPhone, the display does not show the name of the carrier all the time—but that can be easily verified in the Quick Setting panel. (I mean, I know who my carrier is; I just like to know that the telephony function of the phone is working properly.)As for the quality of phone calls, I haven't used it long enough, but the first call I made sounded okay. At this point, I would probably give the iPhone a slight edge in sound quality.I haven't tried the earbuds yet, but then I rarely use my phone to listen to music, so this isn't much of a concern for me.(A note about the packaging: because they've hidden it under the lid covering the compartments of the box that contain the USB cable, charger, and earbuds, the tool used to open the card holder is very easy to miss. I had already used the one that came with the SIM card adapter I bought at the same time as the phone when I finally noticed it was there.)Apart from a few hiccups that go with getting used to a new OS, I am liking the Idol 3 so far. It's a light phone with a great display, good sound, and good battery life, and I didn't have to spend an exorbitant amount of money to get it.\n",

The Screen is bright and pretty - all colors stand out and the HD display proves its amazing.Under $200, this is an amazing smartphone, and one would expect it to cost at least under $400.

      "I cannot compare this Smartphone to any other product because this is the only smart phone I've ever had.I bought it a year ago because it was unlocked and I could use my Tracfone Account and because of its many features so that I could use it for virtual reality, gaming and 4G LTE phone.I am writing this review after year of owning this phone and I have to say I am still totally happy with it. I have to stifle the impulse to say I am amazed at the quality and usefulness of this device.I bought it with Android 5.0 1 and recently it updated - 6.01. I didn't know it would do that! It was a bonus.My only problem is the 16 gigabytes. The Android operating system does not use the SD card efficiently, and so I had problems with filling your memory with too many apps and data. This is not a problem with the phone but more a problem with the operating system. Although if the phone has more memory that would have been a solution for me.This phone has been a joy for me and I would recommend to anyone!\n",

      "I can never seem to settle on a phone. I splurge on the latest new device, only to regret it for some reason or another. Sold my Moto G because the camera was terrible, sold my Note 4 because I think having a $700 phone is ridiculous.Wanted LTE band 12 (T-Mobile is building out their network coverage in rural areas especially with this frequency not supported yet by many phones), a big screen, dual band WiFi, and a price under $300.Initially passed over this phone and Alcatel altogether because it seemed like a very low end brand. This device has changed my opinion of the company. I also looked at the zte zmax and huawei p8 lite, but this Idol 3 seemed to be the best combination of affordability and features.Very customizable and near stock Android lollipop. Great screen, great speakers, decent build quality, decent main camera (seems about as good as my old S4 which was fine), above average front facing camera. Too bad it doesnt have a replaceable battery, but not a huge deal. Doesnt seem like an octa core processor, lagging at times, although not enough to annoy.I usually install custom software on my phones, but after using this phone for a while, turning off double tap to wake, and uninstalling almost all of the preinstalled apps, I like it the way it is.Because it was cheap for a smartphone, I won't be devastated if it gets dropped or cracked. Turn off double tap to wake, uninstall unwanted apps, install a different launcher if you want, install Google keyboard, be careful installing the sim card, dont expect it to behave like a $700 Note 4, and enjoy!\n",

The one thing that really bugged me was the call quality. Not sure how I sounded to others but on my end voice quality sounded hollow and tinny and whatever I was listening to kept fading in and out. Pretty sure it was the phone because my cheaper back-up phone doesn't have those issues. I eventually decided to return the phone for a refund. I think a better choice, in the same price range, would be the Huawei Ascend Mate 2. Bigger screen and killer battery life. For something cheaper go with BLU.\n",

      "If you read through these reviews, you will notice that most are from people who have just purchased the phone. At first flush, the OneTouch Idol 3 is an amazing phone. It's a beautiful phone, and it's internal components are first-rate. I never had better speeds on the T-Mobile network. It seems like a great phone, and the price cannot be beat for what you get.However, this is a one star review for a reason. The phone has one dramatic flaw is only noticeable after a few months of ownership. And it's a flaw that renders the phone unusable. To keep the price down, Alcatel did not use Gorilla Glass for the big and beautiful screen. It's probably how they kept the price of this phone so low. This and this alone is a reason to look elsewhere for your next phone. All it takes is a small drop or accidentally sitting on the phone to crack the glass. And it doesn't just crack, it shatters like a window pane.The glass will shatter even if you have the phone in a hard case, which is what happened to me (twice, with two different phones). Sadly, this is a known issue and Alcatel will not replace your phone, even under warranty.\n",

      "This phone is great! I hadn't had any real problems out of it except for when it did not wake up at one time. I tapped, I pressed the power button and I even called it, mind you this was after the most recent update. I ended up having to do a hard reset on it, so far no further problems. The only thing that I don't like is that you don't have access to emojis on social media but other than its a very good phone definitely worth $250 bucks.UPDATE!!!!!!!Well I have had this phone for a while now and I loved it, the only problems Ive had with this phone are ones that Ive caused myself, as far as the phone messing up on its own, no problems. The worst thing about this phone is the screen is not durable at all, one tap against a chair and it cracks and the screen does not work, cant unlock it, cant do anything, my galaxy s3 is way more durable than this. I recommend getting a tempered glass protector for it and the most durable case you can, but generally as long as you have the tempered glass you can just about use any case you would like. Ive searched all over for a phone that might compare to this, tired of Samsung products and their UI and notification sounds, to poor for anything else that I might genuinely like, ran across the HONOR 5X but it doesnt have a reversible interface and it hasnt been released yet, I'm not patient enough to wait a couple months for reviews so I figure I will just order this again, Win WIn.\n",

      "It's a great phone with annoying issues.What I like about the phone:Has the best display on a budget phone and can go head to head with any flagship phone.Has great speakers and audio experience. This phone sounds better than a lot of the flagships out there. The speaker and headset port produce some great sound. This phone easily competes with all the flagships in the audio category and beats if not all than most.GPS, alcatel got it right, it's so hard to find an android phone with flawless gps performance. This phone locks on in quickly and is pretty accurate, the moto g is pretty good in this regard as well. My galaxy s6 ($600 phone) has issues with gps performance.Battery: You can easily make it through the day again this beats my s6 but not as good as a note 4. For the price it beats a lot of flagships in the battery category.What I don't like (mostly software issues)Cell reception: It's worse than my old galaxy s4, s6, and note. I can easily get lte on my other phones and this phone barely gets HDSPA. Sometimes drops to edge. The download speed is slower. But what annoys me the most is when I'm in a good area and the phone sticks on hdspa and doesn't switch to lte. I noticed that this happens much more often when my radio is set to lte/wcdma/gsm more than lte/wcdma. So I have to manually switch it by going into the test settings through dial codes.Brightness: For some reason randomly the phone will dim all the way randomly, even with auto brightness turned off, me being outside, and the display set to full brightness. Which can make following directions or reading something outside very annoying.Background audio: Sometimes when I watched a youtube video put it on pause and turned off the display. Get a notification and the youtube video starts playing with the screen still off. It's annoying, and another software bug. Youtube isn't the only application to do this, for me most applications do this.Double tap: Turn it off, too many butt dials with the feature turned on.So great hardware, but there are some software issues, I'm checking for updates every day. I really want to keep this device. But my old cheaper moto g didn't have any of these issues. I think alcatel has a great device but for some reason way too many software bugs that needed to be ironed out before launch.\n",

I don't know why other companies think they can improve on something I am sure Google spent a lot of time developing...Pros- UI- The reversible speaker and home screen. I prefer having the headphone jack at the bottom when listening to music.- ScreenCons- My only complaint is that the double tap on feature doesn't work consistently.

Try to download a better camera app. Or edit your pics for improvement of the color. Watching videos and listen to music is really great. The only thing I don't like it takes too much time to charge. But besides that I can say it's a great phone. But don't expect too much. But still it's one of the best phone in this price range.\n",

      "So far, a great phone. I did a lot of research when deciding on a new phone in this price range. I listen to a lot of music on the run and the tipping point in favor of the Idol 3, for me, was the front facing stereo speakers.I've had the phone for a few days now, and I'm very impressed with it. The user interface is pretty much stock Lollipop, which I really appreciate. There is very little bloatware/shovelware taking up memory and what there is can be easily removed. The camera is average and takes decent pictures under the right conditions. Bluetooth paired up with all my devices, even the more finicky devices that have given me fits in the past. Call quality is really good and the voices are clear on both ends. Signal reception has been the same as my old phone and I have had no issues connecting to the network. WIFI connections are as expected and I have had no issues.I dropped in a 128Gb micro SD card and it is working as expected. I haven't had a chance to test out the NFC connection, but It's nice to have this capability.The real shocker is the sound quality. The front facing stereo speakers are really impressive. They are loud and you can crank it up with no distortion. Everyone I've demo'ed this for has had the same reaction, \"Whoa, that is impressive\". Are you going to replace your home sound system? Of course not, But you get some pretty big sound from some pretty small speakers. The other surprise was from the included ear buds. I wasn't expecting much, but they sound pretty good for being included in the box. They have flat, no tangle cables and include different size ear pieces. They are a little flat sounding in the mid range, but not objectionably so. They won't replace my more expensive ear buds, but if these were the only ones I had, I'm not sure I would be that quick to replace them. I definitely won't be throwing these out.All in all I am very happy with this phone. It has great features and the sounds is incredible. On top of all that it functions well as a phone. In my opinion, this is a good value for the money.\n",

      "I\"m giving this phone a 3 because there seems to be (for me) a fundamental flaw in the ergonomics of the phone. The way the switches are set up they are never in the right place. Also, I seem to be constantly grabbing the phone and hitting the switches at the same time, which seems to try and shut the phone down, or take a screenshot of the phone, neither of which I like. It took me a while to figure out that when I was trying to shoot a photo I was gripping the phone in a manner that I hit the buttons and it kept shutting down.I've had similar android phones and never had this issue.The icons are cartoon-y (I put an icon pack in to create shortcuts so I didn't have to look at them) and the phone seems rather slow to respond (for example, when you change screens or shut down the open apps). The phone seems to work ok, when I'm not having trouble manipulating it, and the setup was relatively simple and straightforward (coming from another unlocked android).I would not buy the phone again, but will keep it for now as I don't want the hassle of getting another phone. My old one stopped working so this purchase, while researched, was made a bit more quickly than I might of liked.\n",

      "Had both ASUS ZenPone 2 and ALCATEL IDOL 3 for two of my family members. Both phones look great. Both handle 4g LTE well.Side by side comparison of the two:1) the IDOL3 got better and more premium sound for enjoying the movies/games than ZenPone 2.2) However, ZenPhone 2 got much faster responses in all apps comparing to IDOL 3. If you need to do multitasking and use business apps, I will choose ZenPhone 2, but not IDOL 3.3) Regarding the talk quality, ZenPhone 2 is better than IDOL 3!4) ZenPhone 2 is heavier than IDOL 3 and solidly build. In contrast, IDOL 3 is much lighter and more like a jewelry and prone to break.Both are good phones.Personally, I favor ASUS ZenPhone 2 than IDOL3 for its Two Sim capability/Faster responses/Easily handling the multitasking for my daily business usage. However, if you only need a phone for entrainment, than IDOL 3 is a better choice than ZenPhone 2 for its much better speaker sounds (but not for the talking quality). As a T mobile user in both phones, I found Zenfone 2 had a better talking quality than IDOL 3.\n",

      "I lucked out and was able to buy the Idol 3 for $199 shortly before midnight on Amazon’s Prime Day blow-out. I gotta say, Alcatel did an exceptional design job on the Idol 3. I believe it’s the best value smartphone on the market.Pros:- Superb screen. Easy to use in bright sunlight, which makes picture taking a breeze on a sunny day.- JBL sound, through both the speakers and the headset, is outstanding. The included JBL headphones are excellent with clear mids & highs and distortion-free tight bass.- The build quality on this phone is exceptional. Feels good in your hands, with no hint of cheapness, flimsiness, or low quality material Buttons presses are firm and manufacturing seams are aligned and tight. It’s also remarkably light and thin.- Before I got the phone I thought the reversible user interface (UI) was something that, although slick, I doubted I’d use very much. On the contrary, being able to reverse the UI comes in pretty handy and I use it quite a lot. For instance, sometimes it’s convenient to have headphones plugged into the top of the phone, and other times it’s better for me to have the cord coming out of the bottom (like on my dashboard car mount). With the reversible screen that’s not an issue.- I love the the double-tap feature. Super convenient, particularly in the car. However, it can occasionally be inconsistent. (see “Cons” below).- Volume & Power button placement: A lot of reviewers dislike the placement of the vol and power buttons because they’re located high on the phone’s sides. However, I actually prefer this button placement because: a) as I’m holding or carrying the phone, I’m not constantly hitting the buttons, and, b) in my car, it allows me to put the phone in my dashboard car mount such that the mount’s clamp is not pressing the buttons.- Call quality: Call quality is good. I hear no distortion or tinny-ness.- Overall processor performance: I’m not a big-time power user or gamer, so the Idol 3 performs reliably and predictably for me. Occasionally I do experience a slight stutter, but it’s so minor that it’s no big deal. Navigation around the UI is generally smooth and hiccup-free.- Camera: Picture quality stacks up nicely with other phones, some which cost a lot more. For all but the most demanding needs, the Idol 3 will deliver crisp, focused shots with good color balance. I have not used it much in low light, so I can’t comment on that aspect.- GPS locks on quickly, and Wi-Fi connects reliably.- Battery life: the Idol 3’s battery life is a dream compared to my old HTC Inspire, which I had to recharge throughout a typical workday. I’m easily getting thru my workday with charge to spare. The battery charges quickly too, due to the 2amp wall charger.Cons:- An occasional UI stutter, as mentioned above.- The volume sliders can only be set to 8 incremental, discrete intervals; I wish the volume sliders were continuously variable (like the brightness slider).- The Idol 3’s vibration mode is very weak. If the phone is set to vibrate mode and it’s laying on my desk, I often cannot detect when a vibrating call or text is coming in.- If you have the double-tap feature enabled, you sometimes have to repeatedly double-tap in order to wake the screen up, particularly when it’s been asleep for an extended period.- This is big phone and will take a bit of getting used to if you have smaller hands. Although, I must say it’s nicely balanced. I have med/large hands and didn’t find the Idol 3 particularly slippery or hard to grip.- The user manual is not very comprehensive. Tech support is located in Guadalajara, Mexico. I called tech support to address a few questions I had; the support I received was of average competence, … not terrible but not great.In Conclusion:The overall performance of the Idol 3 at the $249 price point is outstanding. It’s half the price of, say, an LG G4, and side-by-side, stacks up nicely. The phone does everything I ask of it and then some. Call quality is good, the speakers kick some serious butt, the screen resolution and brightness are superb, the camera works great for me, and battery life is excellent. Unless you just have to have top-tier specs, this is the best “bang for the buck” smartphone on the market.\n",

      "After about a week of use, I have very little to complain about with this phone. The very bright and sharp display is easy to read in sunlight, the sound is as clear and loud as I've ever seen in a smartphone. Was worried that the 5.5\" screen would feel too big in my hand, but it actually fits well in my hand. The power button placement is a little high on the left side, but I've already gotten used to it. 4G LTE reception with Cricket Wireless has been solid, and I get a full day of battery life, even with a few hours of screen time. The phone feels thin and light but still feels solid.

      "I have had the phone for a week now and here is my honest opinion. As you see, that I have given the phone 5 stars. This rating is for comparison to other phones in it's price range. I am not going to try and compare this phone with IPhone or Samsung. I have T-Mobile and I am on a no-contract employee plan that requires me to buy my phones outright. So price is a BIG deal. IMO the phone is great! Here are my honest thoughts:- Screen Size and looks is great! Very readable in the sun. Well above it's $250 price tag- The ONLY lag I ever experience is when I am sweeping running apps. And that is hardly a lag. It is very fluid and responsive.- No Dropped Calls- My LTE T-Mobile data has been 12.5 mbps- Front facings speakers are amazing and sound great. BUT they are louder than I want them to be at the lowest setting. I have Triplets Babies and when they are asleep, I can't have headphones in and the audio on the lowest setting is still too loud.- The Camera is Great! No issues or complaints.- The double tap to turn it on is unreliable and works less than 50% of the time. Double tapping to turn off works just fine.- BUT I am right handed and I have no issues with where the on/off button is. I don't know why others have complained.- I love the I can talk into either end of the phone. Especially when using the google search. It hears me every time!- The GPS is great and on-time! The front facing speakers were great to hear the turn by turn directions.- The head phones sound great!- The reversible setting is awesome and such a duh idea.- This may be an Android problem but is really annoying… but any group messaging that I have gets a date of Jan 17, 1970 and so they just sit at the bottom of my messages log. It’s VERY Annoying and I can’t figure out how to fix that. Anyone else have this problem?- Battery Life is about a day in a half. I use my phone mostly with Calls, Texts, Twitter, Facebook, Email, Camera, Internet. (Occasionally the GPS and Netflix, no gaming.)- In all, the phone is not \"perfect\". But just as close as it's going to be at this price. Definitely worth 5 stars and I recommend it every time!Now I just need a case. Not a bulky one. Any recommendations?\n",

      "Great phone, great price. I shopped around for a budget-priced phone with up to date specs. I spent days on this, and decided on this phone because it was $100 less than I was willing to spend but it still had everything I needed. My only concern at purchase was I thought battery life would be an issue coming off a phone with a 5000 MaH battery I had with the BLU Studio Energy 2. What I do is go into settings and turn on battery saver immediately after taking the phone off the charger. That way I get about 18 hours of fairly active use, calling, texting, streaming video, listening to audio. Then I put on charger and am ready for the next day. It has a 2950 MaH battery but lasts more like a 4000 MaH one on battery saver mode. Phone is super fast with octa-core processor, even running on battery saver - I can't really tell the difference in performance, but it's limiting the background processes that drain the juice out of most phones. Phone ships with Android 5.1, but it quickly upgrades to the newer Android Marshmallow 6.0 software upon initial bootup. Also, phone has an 8MP selfie camera, 5MP is standard on many phones which is ice. The front camera is decent at 13MP, on par with a Samsung S6. Nice display and beautiful video. At 5.5\" it's the right size and the build quality is impressive. Good sound from the JBL twin speakers, you can actually hear. Call quality seems to be good (I'm on Cricket), and the speakerphone comes in loud and clear. It even comes with NFC built-in if that's important to you. Overall, it's a 5-star phone at a 3-star price point and it has my highest recommendation.\n",

      "This is the cheapest phone I've ever bought and one of the best I've ever had. Having used it constantly everyday for almost a month now I knew I had to review it.Let's start with the physical: The phone is thin with a sleek design comparable to some flagships out there. It is ultra lightweight to the point that I don't feel it in my purse; sometimes I actually rummage through my bag to make sure it's still there. The screen is big and pictures are clear and crisp. Same sound-wise, I haven't had any dropped calls or had people on the other end telling me they can't hear me so it's definitely a jump up from my last android which was more than double the price.Now the technical: To start with I purchased a 32gb SDHC card to take advantage of the expandable storage so I didn't have to skimp out on any apps I used, and as a long time T-Mobile customer I was able to get the SIM card for free. I immediately put the cards in and voila I had a working phone. [Disclaimer: There are no features from T-Mobile that I do not have access to, unless there are features out there that I am not aware of].So the important stuff, I am in love with the eye scanner (HOW COOL IS THAT) which can be used as a lock screen mechanism. It makes me feel like a secret spy agent! Unlike fingerprint readers which seem outdated now, I'm able to impress my friends and family with an eye scanner. I also very much enjoy the camera which pulls up with two presses of the power button, it beats tapping on a screen that isn't always responsive in a moment's notice. I can capture vital images quickly and accurately in a moving vehicle or when I'm at a concert, which is simply awesome especially for the price tag. Lastly, the fast charging nature of this phone puts me in awe. I use the phone for hours on end and yes the battery drains like a normal phone does, but then all I have to do is plug it in and my phone gets charged in no time! I can also keep playing my games, video chatting and having multiple apps and webpages open with no lag and without pausing to let the phone charge, and a regular car charger gets my phone charged even when I have Waze or Google Maps on.Overall I highly recommend this phone, if it somehow died I would buy another one without hesitation. This phone is comparable to flagships in terms of design and basic features one looks for in a phone. And for the price it truly is unbeatable without being inferior.\n",

      "I am an iPhone freak. I was looking to add another phone(a moderately priced one as it'll only serve as my iPhone's 'assistant') with a different OS from apple's iOS. A phone with the android OS was my preferred choice. I gave up on my search because I didn't get what I needed in a moderately priced android phone till I saw a friend with the 4.7 inch version of the idol 3. I browsed through and was like 'whaaat, Alcatel did this'? The phone fast, has a good camera, has good speakers and good battery life, because after about 30 minutes of watching videos, the battery didn't drain as it would've on my iPhone 6. I bought one of the 4.7 for my personal use due to its cute size and 4 of the 5.5 to sell. In my country, bigger screen phones sells faster, plus the 5.5 is the better of the two in terms of performance. It's been about a year now and none of the buyers has called to complain about anything. A special someone needs an android OS phone and the only phone that came to mind was the idol 3, my reason for buying again. We had an issue before I received the phone. I am waiting till the issue is resolved before presenting the phone. She'll love it(because she's always praised mine every time she's played with it), and even more because this screen size bigger than mine.\n",

Battery like is solid and the added benefit of expandable storage with a very stock interface (after adding the Google launcher) are an added bonus. The only issue with this phone is the camera.

      "Update December 30th, 2015:* I had to downgrade my rating to a 3 star because after 6 months of usage the phone is noticeably showing wear and tear of being a cheap phone. I had no illusion that the phone would be masterfully constructed at the price point. At this point I can feel that the phone creaks if bent a little bit, and I can see that my screen cover's glue has come off at one edge. To top this off the camera has failed me recently, and I'm in the process of submitting a warranty claim. If that goes well and this are better, then I'll consider bumping the star rating back up to 4 stars....Original Review follows, and all of these things are still true for me. I do really love what this phone got right, its just too bad its not constructed better...Here are a few thing that should make you want this phone:* The Camera app - Alcatel seems to have made their own camera app, and do not use the Android stock app (which if you want you could install from the app store). But this app I feel like is superior to the android one. It does virtually no hunting for focus, and takes photos immediately when you press the shutter button. I feel like this gives the camera a distinctly Apple Iphone feel to it, and have been pleasantly surprised. The Google Camera app does not function as smoothly, and am glad to have an alternative with the Alcatel. Others have commented on the actual camera photo quality itself, which I have not tested, but honestly for my use I'm glad that the app just functions fast.* The phone is pretty much stock android. I put the Google Now Launcher on my phone and the experience is almost exactly the same as my old Nexus 4. There are a few pre-loaded apps, but you can easily remove them. The ones that you can't remove are system apps like the android gallery, and the Mix application which is a music player. Both can be ignored for your applications of choice.With that said, other reviews have done a good job of describing the phone and its pros and cons. I just wanted to add the only reason I can't give it a 5, is that while it is awesome for the price, it still has its drawbacks. It does so many things great, and they got many features totally right. But after using it for 4 or 5 days, I begin to notice the areas where they had to cut corners to get it to the price it is at. These things have been mentioned in other reviews already. With that said. Its amazing how much they do for the price, but they haven't quite hidden the reasons you might want a more expensive phone, in my opinion. If you're already in the market for spending this much, instead of buying something much more expensive, then I can say you should definitely just buy it and try it out.\n",

      "I moved from a Note II (T-Mobile) to this Idol 3. I got tired of carrying around a phone that had extra weight and size due to a stylus I never used. I got in on the original pre-order price of $200 and decided to give it a try. I have had the phone a little over a week and would like to run down some of my thoughts.- I like the screen, it is clear and bright and I don’t find myself missing my AMOLED from my Note II.- The screen is very visible in direct sunlight, way better than my Note II, wife’s S3 or G2.- I do not mind the left side power button (I’m left handed) but it takes some getting used to.- Regarding the above I am aware the phone has a double tap to wake/sleep function however I have found it very inconsistent. My wife’s G2 is much more consistent, I would say hers works 95% of the time and this about 50% (to wake, to sleep is much more consistent). I sent an email to Alcatel and they claim they are aware of this issue and plan on addressing it in an update.- It is very light and easy to use with my “medium” sized guy hands.- Case selection is somewhat limited.- It works well with T-Mobile, I get LTE where I did with my Note II and have no issue with wifi, Bluetooth or GPS. I do miss the stock T-Mobile voicemail app (the play store one is buggy).- The camera is quick to focus and takes pretty good photos. Video is good as well. I consider it as good as the one I had on my Note II (I liked that camera).- I like that it is not cluttered with bloat wear. My T-Mobile branded phone was loaded with all kinds of app’s I could not remove. I think this lends to the phone’s efficient use of resources.- Battery life has been good so far, I get through a day. I am a bit apprehensive about the lack of a replaceable battery. I always like the idea of being able to replace/swap mine on my Note II.6/12/15 Update -- The lowest setting for volume for the notifications is way to loud. There are plenty of apps to \"boost\" volume but I can not find a good one for a work around here.- I have not been get 5ish hours of screen on time as many reviewers state. I usually get to about 4 with about 10% battery left. I am not a heavy gamer. Just email, reading web pages and texting. A smattering of clash of clans here and there.\n",

      "I decided to buy this phone on a whim after reading several early reviews. I'm glad I did. No, it's not perfect, but you have to consider what you get for your money. Other reviewers have gone into great detail about pros and cons so I won't repeat here. There are a few quirks, but in my opinion, the pros far outweigh the cons. I thought there was a problem with my external SD card when I couldn't access files on the card. It turned out my card was formatted in exFat. Once I formatted it to Fat32, all was well. When I was setting up my phone I somehow lost 2 screen panels and ended up with only one. I had to factory reset and that cured the problem. Also, sometimes the screen digitizer can be a little balky. The speakers are quite good as are the included earbuds. Maybe not as good as HTC's, but still good. The screen is very good for a phone at this price point. The camera was also a pleasant surprise. No, it won't beat the Galaxy S6 or iphone6, but you won't be disappointed either. I found no lag others have mentioned, but then again, I don't play games or launch multiple apps at once. For what I do, it was as smooth as butter. You will get through a day on the battery unless you are a heavy user. Unless you're a true perfectionist, I can't imagine anyone being disappointed with this phone when they consider it cost $250 for a no-contract, unlocked phone.\n",

I decided to give it a test drive. This phone isn't very powerful . I am going to give a review on what's important to me. 1. Signal. It's allover the place fading in from full bars to no bars of LTE . I discovered if I put it in hspa it's fairly stable . In areas that have a great LTE Signal It's fantastic. 2. Call quality. It's middle of the road not great , not horrible. The moto g4 plus is way better , but the g4 has VOLTE . The idol 3 doesnt.3, battery , it's a little better than okay . If I don't use it , it will last . If I do use it it is just like every other phone .4. Responsiveness. I have a galaxy s7 edge . I am used to touchwiz lag . This phone lags as much as my Samsung . I did change the settings in developer options. 5. Screen ..not bad its fairly bright. 6. Storage it's been updated to 6.1,1. It now has adaptive storage . Buy a good SD card if you are going to use it as adaptive storage.7. Size for 5.5 it feels pretty small and very light. I put a glass screen protector on and my favorite slim case. It feels and looks pretty nice.8. Emails and text they work well. I think if t-mobile didn't force Alcatel to disable band 12 (or if Alcatel paid for band 12 license this review would be better. All in all if you can grab it for 99$ do it. But for more go with the honor 5x or moto g4 . For some reason I like this phone .its over a year old now and still a decent performer .\n",

On a recent trip, I was amazed at how useful their phones were during our travel (Uber, Lyfte, AirBNB, Airline information, Maps) and decided I would get ready for my contract renewal in a few months, by getting a cheap smartphone and loading it up, via WIFI connection at home. Read the reviews and this one was priced at $99. Why not? It's been a week, and it has been eye-opening. It's replacing my clip on MP3 player, cause it plays MP4s as well. The sound is incredible. I have a 64 GB microSD with all my music, that I hot swap into the phone's dual slide. The slide has space for a microSD and a SIM card. I enjoy the built-in radio, Skyping, and using Viber on my WIFI. I've got apps to read Word and Excel documents, my G-mail updates...it goes on and on. It does take around 20 seconds to boot to a visible screen once you press the on button, and I think that may fool many into thinking the phone isn't working, as they repeating hit the on/off button. Just push on, and have patience. The OS also rebooted several times over the first few days, but after a week, that has finally stopped. Camera takes good pictures but not great. It's been fun, and I haven't even activated my phone yet. Once I do, and probably with Cricket, which uses AT&T towers, everything should be ready and I won't have a learning curve.\n",

Similar or better form factor too, with nice stereo speakers and better earbuds than an Iphone. Performance is smooth, and it updated immediately to Marshmallow. What's not to like?I guess one thing. Reports around the web indicate the screen may crack under light pressure/drops. So get a case and screen protector.

I would recommend this for anyone who's hard of hearing.I was deciding between this and the Asus ZenFone2 and went by reviews both had good reviews, but I went with the Idol.The camera is good, but I use a different camera app with it for more effects.The battery life is great and it charges quickly more than an Android tablet I have.The screen is nice and clear, the ease of access is good and Alcatel does do the update, for it when it lets you know for an OTA.The only non-issues I have that's there's not enough accessories being the fact it's been out for a few months.

      "For the price, the only device that can compare to this for the price is the zenfone 2. The zf2 has a more powerful processor, GPU and 2x the ram for $50 more. Even though I'm usually all about specifications on my devices, I don't play graphically intense games on my phone. (that's what a PC or console is for in my opinion) So I'll take the better screen, slimmer profile, almost completely stock version of Android and the dual JBL audio front facing speakers any day over the slight difference in performance.I've seen some reviews of people receiving units with a few annoying problems but I'm assuming those are either factory defects or refurbished units because I've had nothing but good experiences so far with mine.If I had to find something negative to say about this phone, I'd say the power button placement doesn't make sense at all even for a lefty. But the factory software does allow for double tap to wake and the display does rotate 180° in portrait which takes care of the button placement for the most part. The second thing is that I've noticed a few stutters here and there, and considering I came from a note 3 with the SD800, these slight stutters happen so infrequently that it doesn't bother me and I didn't really pay attention to them till I read about it in some reviews. Either way, I'm pretty sure this is because of the software optimization because other SD615 devices run smother. Hopefully an update to 5.1 or even marshmallow will cure this. If not, bootloader is already unlocked, root is her and there's already twrp available. Custom ROMs should be available soon too.\n",

      "First things first, this is not a perfect phone, but it is pretty damn close and factoring the price I got it for $99, this has been one of the better phones I have used recently. So long story short, broke my Nexus 6 and didn’t want to spend a lot of money on a new phone. I tried out a Sony Ultra C5, I didn’t like the screen at all, otherwise nice phone, so I sold it. Then I tried an LG G3 and it was a great phone but the GPS and camera were terrible. Finally I saw this phone on sale for $99 and figured why not?Well it was a great decision. This phone has been updated to Android 6.01 and everything runs well on it for the most part. This is not a fast phone, but it is a fast enough phone. I am able to browser this Internet, play emulators, and watch movies with ease. Again, it isn’t perfect but for $100, or around that price, it is an amazing value!Highlights:- Fast enough CPU/GPU (with occasional freezes/stuttering, but doesn't get too hot)- Expandable storage- Wonderful front facing speakers that can fill a small room with sound- Decent 1080p IPS LCD screen- Near stock android skin- Excellent all day (with moderate usage) battery life- Fantastic 8mp rear facing camera- Great audio quality with headphones- Surprisingly good call quality- Built in music app is fun and useful- NO BLOATWARELowlights:- Front facing camera is only average with poor low light performance- Multi Media messages like group texts, email texts, and photo texts don’t work on stock messaging app- CPU/GPU does stutter occasionally- Phone is a bit ungainly and slippery in hand for one-hand usagePro-tipsTo fix the MMS bug I mentioned about texts under lowlights, use a third party program off the Google Play Store such as Textra. Additionally, I disabled the “enhanced 4G LTE” setting on the phone and that seemed to help.As for the display, it is great for the price, but it tends to run a little on the “cooler” side in terms of color. You can adjust your color hue under settings. I personally bumped it up one on the color warmth and it looks significantly better. Furthermore, the phone display is extremely bright so things may look a little washed out. To fix this, find an area that is well lit (one that represents where you spend most of your day), and then slide the brightness all the way down, then slowly increase it until you find the colors have the right look about them. Personally, I have mine set to about 35-40% brightness. You can always flip the brightness to “auto” when you go into an extremely bright or dark area.\n",

However compared to my last phone the audio stream over blutooth is not as loud, meaning in my car I have to turn the dial up in order to have the same volume. I'd advise turning off the JBL special effects otherwise you'll end up with muddled music that is overly bassy, Although maybe you'll like it.

I was a little sceptical about reading a lot of negative reviews about the camera on this phone, but I also own the Alcatel Pop One Touch, which takes very nice pictures usually without even using the flash! So, the first I did was to compare my old phone camera with the new one. I took the same pictures side by side, and this is what I found. Out of the box the new cameras exposure settings needed to be adjusted. If you click on the upper left of the camera screen, (there are three short lines), then choose settings--you will see exposure settings, click on the number 1 setting-- (Not -1). This will lighten up the screen for better picture taking. Under normal circumstances, you will not need a flash even inside your home! This will greatly improve your all around camera quality!! Hope it helps!! Great phone!\n",

I don't do selfies, so I don't know how well the front camera works (as indicated above, I'm old).The sound is MUCH better than the Samsung, both from the speaker and headphones, and the music program is easy to use and plays FLAC files.It is light enough that even with an armored case it isn't too heavy, and I quickly got used to the size. It is easier to carry on my belt, but it fits in my pocket. The S6 seems too small to me now, and I will almost certainly get another 5.5\" phone next time..I would have no hesitation buying another Alcatel phone when this one is ready to retire in another year or two. Or maybe three if it keeps working, since it certainly is meeting my phone, e-mail, snapshot and web surfing needs very well.\n",

      "Decent phone, shame it died one day after the one year warranty ended. It was while I was playing kingdom hearts unchained x. Symptoms were: phone got hot, touch screen became unresponsive on and off, the next day blue screen, rebooted, another blue screen, then phone completely died.Dual front facing speakers that get nice and loud so that's a huge plus, mine came with jbl earbuds which is awesome considering how most phones don't even include them anymore. But, the placement of the auxiliary port is located at the top of the phone and this is weird because the mini usb port is located on the bottom. If you used one of those magnetic air vent phone holders for you car, things will get messy as there's no clear orientation to have good cable management when you want to plug the auxiliary cable to your phone while charging. However, the reversible design is nice so that you can make the auxiliary cable be located on the bottom relatively by putting the phone upside down.Coming from a samsung galaxy s3, the idol 3's screen is much more vibrant. Also the phone is about 7mm thin which is just 1mm thicker than the thinnest phone out there. Also you should plan on getting a case for the phone, the back of this phone is really slippery with zero grip which is awful for such a thin phone. So if you get sweaty hands due to the heat emitted from this phone, the chance of it falling is quite high. Another plus was that alcatel did provide a software update to Android Marshmallow, which no one thought they would do considering the idol 4 was coming out, the idol 3 was made by a chinese company which don't really provide software support, and that the idol 3 was a budget phone. The stock os doesn't really come with a lot of bloat, although surprisingly, the clock app that comes with the phone is actually made by avg, the same guys that make the antivirus, which no one would have found out until one day play store decided to update the clock app. The updated clock app was terrible because it went away from the google's material design to some awkward interface. The average rating was around 2 stars before avg reverted back to the original clock app. The biggest con I would have to mention is the very slow flash storage, this is really noticeable when you load files or install apps in the play store.Oh well, time to get a new phone and this is just a lesson to always back up your texts and photos as well as get an extended warranty if you plan on using the phone for a very long time. Especially on devices like these where there is no removable back cover. I set the expected usage to a year anyways when I bought the phone considering it was only 250 when I bought it. The phone did get cheaper, but that's to be expected as time goes on.-----update 9/13/16---------Wow, so they still honored the warranty when my phone died. Fantastic service; they went above and beyond. They shipped the phone back with 2 day ups air too.\n",

The Call quality is good and audio quality is great but got disappointed when it didn't arrive with the JBL headset (that's why the 4 Star)....overall i am satisfied with the purchase and i would recommend to everyone who wants to have a good smart phone for the daily use........\n",

      "The phone I received is model number 5017O-2AALUS1, which meets the description of the \"Global\" Pixie 3 4.5\" -- with one notable exception: It has 4.28GB of total memory, not 8GB.I'm including screen shots from \"Settings-Storage\" and \"Settings--About Phone\" which show the model number and actual memory of my phone. This was a disappointment since I need and expected 8GB. I have since tried without success to find a Pixi 3 4.5\" with 8GB of memory.While it is too limited to be my primary phone at home, I am keeping it to use while traveling in Europe. In addition to the 4G LTE frequencies used by AT&T, T-Mobile, and other GSM operators on this side of the pond, it has the primary European 4G LTE frequency. My home phone does not.On the whole, this is a suitable phone for beginners, those on a budget, and anyone who doesn't need enough memory to run a lot of apps. The screen resolution is less than on more expensive models, which means text and images appear larger. On a 4.5-inch screen, that's a nice benefit for people like me who are a tad hard of seeing.\n",

      "I like this ALCATEL OneTouch Pixi 3 4.5-inch CELL PHONE!The 4.5\" size is not too big for my hand! I thought I'd never want anything bigger than my 3.5\" ipod, but I am able to hold this in one hand and touch the buttons without any difficulty.As a phone -- it works great -- I can hear clearly and so can the person on the other end. So far, no problems with sound at all.The camera works fine -- takes a good, clear photo. There are TWO cameras -- one front for FaceTime or Skype and one on the back for taking photos.The mobile operating system -- Android Lollipop 5.0 -- has so far allowed me to make calls without any problems.It's UNLOCKED. Global System for Mobile (GSM) for mobile communication means that I will be able to change the SIM card when I go to Europe. (At least I hope so -- I haven't tried this yet.) It also means I can change from AT&T to a different carrier if I wish to in the future. I can use pre-paid wireless plans, rather than sign up for a long-term contract -- I like these features!It holds a charge for days. I don't use this much, but I can leave it on for days before it needs to be charged. If I talked on it constantly, I assume it would need charging more often.Screen shows time and date, strength of mobile signal and wifi signal and battery charge percentage. On screen quick use icons: phone, music, calculator, camera, contact list, product code scanner. After you swipe icons: phone, messaging, menu, email, google, camera, gallery. Press Google and several icons for different apps appear. Press menu and 20 icons appear for different apps.Why do I like it and not love it -- it didn't come with a SIM. I tried to get a Tracfone SIM package at Walmart but they didn't have it. They could order it, though. I went to the at&t store where the sales associate put in the SIM and sold me a package that got progressively more expensive as we went along. First it was $25 -- okay, not too bad. Then another $30 for \"RTR\" (a month's worth of minutes?), then a 40-cent FEE, AND TAX $3.85. I got out of there for $59.25 for the SIM and one month of service! Add this to the cost of the phone and one hopes that this is a phone that will work well for years. (I realize I have to add more minutes and this will cost more.) One big benefit -- the sales rep installed the SIM, let me select from a list of potential phone numbers and then swiped through a series of installation menus. (Thank you Dyllan!)One caveat: I noticed that the sales rep had to scratch off the waxy surface on the SIM package. These \"shavings\" stick to the fingers and could easily get on the SIM card, which is quite small, and \"gum up\" the electronics when the card slips into its slot.This comes with earphones, a manual, charger plug and an in-depth online manual and online support. I couldn't find much online information about installing the SIM and depended on amazon's great Q&A feature and the advice of some very helpful and supportive people.\n",

      " Let's get the specs out of the way. You can find specs online for this model, but I'll make it easy and list the biggies for you:Originally launched in August of 2015Phone Size: 5.55 x 2.81 x 0.39 inDisplay: 480x854 pixels (196 ppi density) This isn't super great but it's respectable, especially if this is your first smart phone!Lollypop OS, likely won’t be upgraded to Marshmallow (that is a guess – I don’t know that for sure but Marshmallow is getting pushed out now) Dual core processorMemory: Internal 8 GB, 1 GB RAM (4G model, which this is) also a micro SD slot up to 32GB but you must add that yourself, it is not included.Camera is a 5 megapixel. Has auto focus, Flash, Geo-taging. Video is 720p at 30 frames per second.. Selfie mode is 2 mp.Has Bluetooth capabilities, and GPS.Battery is a removable and is a 1400mAh battery.What to like about it? It's an inexpensive entry level phone. If you live in an area that gets good service from the providers they listed this would be an excellent option. If you live in an area where you can only get Verizon service (which this phone is not compatible with) then this would not be a good choice as a cell phone. Research what carrier people in your area use to see if it is one of the recommended ones.I found it to be pretty responsive, and it works just like my more expensive Note 4. Google Play store access, and most everything runs fine on this phone that I tested out.This phone has the advantage of the SD slot to add extra memory, which I did. In this way I can put all my movies and music on there and have them handy all the time. 32GB is fairly large and you can fit a lot on there.The battery is removable so if you wanted to buy an extra battery to \"swap out\" in emergencies if you didn't have a way to charge it - that is so handy. I do that with my other phone and I feel sorry for people without removable batteries. I travel a lot and so having that is a huge win.What not to like about it? For me the screen is way too small. But I am used to a HUGE phablet style phone. So for me the small screen seems like a downgrade. You may not feel that way though... it is subjective.Who is this phone good for? First time smart phone users for sure. For kids who you don't want to spend a lot of money to have a phone for, but still need a smart phone. Or budget conscious people. This phone is not very costly. These are the three main groups.\n",

      "I bought this phone as a gift for my friend in Russia. My own phone (LG) cost me $100 and it's great! So the price and the features of ALCATEL OneTouch Pop 3 Global Unlocked 4G satisfied me too.First of all I didn't like both cameras. I'm into photography, I DO know how 5MP and 2MP pictures look like. So the front camera is not even remotely close to 2MP (probably 0.3 or MAX 1MP). The main camera is not that bad but pics come out A LITTLE BIT worse than 5MP. Even though I set both cameras to the highest quality.Well it's okay. Not a big deal... I guess.What has REALLY disappointed me is language settings!!! Yes, this phone has a keyboard in (I guess) any language. You can type in EN, Russian, German etc. BUT there are only FOUR languages available to set as the main language. The phone's menu can be in English, French, Spanish or Italian ONLY. Tha'ts it! I understand that English is an international language but not everyone speaks English! My friend in Russia doesn't! Even my own phone has a bunch of languages including Russian.The menu, apps, notifications are in EN.I spent all day searching for any apps or drivers that could help me to add more languages. Nothing! Btw there are no official drivers for this phone. When I hooked up it to my computer it showed me that it had its own drivers. I clicked \"install\" and NOTHING happened.I am still going to send it to my friend but if only we find out it is not GSM unlocked I will get it back to the US and return to Amazon. I just have a hard time to believe the features that the company has claimed.P.s. I am actually returning this product because I do not trust its description.

It has about a gig of space left on it, and none of the apps I use are very heavy. Not to mention I close them all the time! Going to be looking for a new phone very soon. Will not buy again.\n",

      "Good product. But beware on pricing. I bought this in early December, and 5 days later Amazon reduced the price by $20! Unlike the better B&M stores, unless it is a TV Amazon will NOT provide any price adjustment or offer refunds based on their new price. I chatted, called and talked to several supervisors and their only solution was to mail the product back, then re-order the phone at the lower price. I kindly pointed out that shipping costs and my time would be more than the $20 and it seemed a better solution to offer a \"store credit\" to a long time Prime member. Long story short, no dice. Sine the phone is activated already I am not about to return it and start the activation process all over again either.So, just know that while Amazon is eager to take your money if the price goes UP, they will not offer any relief if within as little time as one week they reduce the price (in this case by 25%). So while the phone is a good investment, not sure about Amazon customer flexibility.\n",

Although the keypad on this one looks nicer it is not as easy to use especially if you like to use punctuation. There's these annoying icons that keep appearing at the top of the screen when you use different things that I don't know how to remove. The battery life is not as good either although not terrible. The camera is terrible as well. It is an okay phone for a dumb phone but I think I will be looking for another one soon.\n",

I just love everything about it!It comes with everything that I would need including a phone case (it was a protective clear case) and a pair of headphones and of course the charger for it. It was really easy and super fast to download any of the apps that I needed. I really liked how it already came with facebook downloaded on it, so I really appreciated that because that app is a must for me.The screen on this cellphone is really huge! I love how great of a picture that it gets! I really enjoy being able to watch my movies and tv episodes on my phone. It's so huge it's almost like watching it on my tablet!The sound is impeccable and very clear and it gets really loud.I really appreciated that I didn't have to go stand in a long line at the phone store to get it turned on and to have everything switched over.All I had to do was just take my sim card out of the old phone and insert it into this one and everything instantly transfers over and it instantly starts working. I am not a big tech savy person but I also don't have the time or patience to stand in the lines at the phone store, so for to be able to just put my sim card in and get it to work is really amazing and I have to say one of my favorite things about this phone because it really saved me time and money this way.It was super fast to be able to not only connect to WiFi, but it was very easy to connect to Bluetooth not to mention how fast it was to connect!This phone has many different options like ringtones and more and this fits my personality so well and has everything on it that I find important to live an every day life when it comes to technology.It's a very affordable phone and I love everything about it!I instantly noticed a big difference with this phone compared to my last one and I can now enjoy so much more on my phone and I love that about this!Disclaimer: I was able to purchase this product at a discount or for free in exchange of my honest and unbiased opinion\n",

      " First of all I would like to mention how slim and elegant this Android 5.1 Smartphone Unlocked 5.5\" from Juning. I got the gold color and I love it!. They also have a white and black color in the website. This has a 1.3 GHz Processor and 512MB RAM/8GB ROM.Below are some of the great features on this phone:Camera - It has a dual camera (both 2MP front and back camera). But the back camera is actually really good. I have attached here some of the photos that I just took using this phone. It also has a smile feature which is pretty cool. When this feature is turned on you will be able to take a picture automatically once a smile has been detected by the camera.Video - With the 5.5\" display you can have a great view of the videos and it is also pretty bright.Air Gesture - When air gesture is turned on you will be able to move the pictures/app by simply swiping your palm on the sensor in front of the phone. This feature can be found under settings - accessibility - gesture.Smart Wake - This feature would let your phone wake up while it is asleep by simply double tapping the screen. You can find this feature under settings - accessibility - gesture - smart wake.Mobile Anti-Theft - With this feature you will be able to remotely take control of your phone when you will lose it or it will get stolen. You just have to add an emergency contact number to this phone. There will be 3 things that you can do. First is to send a message from your emergency contact number a word that states \"#suoding#\" in order to remotely lock your phone so that nobody would be able to access it unless they know your PIN. Second is to send the word \"#xiaohue#\" to completely wipe out the data on your phone and lastly is to send the word \"#mima#\" to fetch back your PIN.Letter Gesture - This is my favorite feature of all because this serves as your quick access to apps/galleries. While your phone is asleep just simply type in the letter that you have set on the black screen. You can customized this with the apps/icons that you prefer. This can be found on settings - accessibility - gesture- letter gestures.The package incudes the following:1 x Cellphone1 x Battery1 x USB Cable1 x Charger1 x Earphone1 x Transparent silicon caseI highly recommend this inexpensive phone to everyone.I got this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I am not affiliated with this company and I am not obliged to provide a positive review when offered a discount. All my opinions are my own which are based on my experience and are in no way influenced by the discount that I received.

The camera is not what its supposed to be which is 8mp its only a 5mp camera. The S pen that it comes with isnt an S pen and dont even work on the phone unless u press hard. Everything about the phone is not what i assumed i was paying for. I bought 2 of these phones one for me and one for my husband and were purchesed at the same time but when the phones arrived i only got one phone and when i contacted the company they said they r sorry for the inconvenience do u still want the phone well yes i want the phone i paid for it. It comes from china so it takes anywhere from 11 to 21 days. I have been in daily contact with the company about these phones due to all the issues with the phone not being what i paid for\n",

      "Picked this up as I'm travelling to the Philippines and wanted a phone I wasn't worried about being stolen.....Paired it with a Tmobile Simple Choice plan to have unlimted data and text roaming overseas.GoodScreen easy to read and bigEasy setup, pop the sim and goBadFeels cheapWon't get anything but 2G on TmobileBattery sucks on Edge (2G), at times barely gets 4 hours standbyGoogle Play is a hacked version with Chinese only, can't seem to install the real one, just errors out. In other words, you're not tying this to your account but can still get Skype, Facebook, etc apps through the chinese hacked one.Can't seem to calibrate the screen, senses touch a bit off so typing is no fun.Overall it will serve its purpose as a travel phone so I don't risk losing my Nexus 5. Other than that its not worth your money. I'll leave mine with a Homeless guy when I leave the PI.There must be several different models as mine has a Samsung rear cover and battery, front looks like Samsung with text over it, boot screen is Samsung, MTK reader shows its a fake, sim slots different than what is shown above on Amazon.

      "[UPDATE: I finally gave up on Chinese knockoffs and ordered a real Samsung S4 Active currently listed for 339 which is less money than I have in imitations. This particular phone would have worked for me [for a while] but I realized I could not live without a functional camera after surprising a Great Heron wading in the pond bordering my yard and catching a wonderful picture of some sort of 7' shadow against an indeterminable washed out background.][UPDATE-2 In the process of changing providers I found myself needing to use two SIM's at once so I brought this phone back into temporary service. The ring alert tells me which line is calling and prompts me to choose a SIM when I cam calling out so it functions well for me using dual SIM.Also, I bought an Extreme Rugged Impact Armor Hybrid Hard Case Cover with Belt Clip Holster and Kickstand for Samsung Galaxy Note 2 N7100 with a soft inner liner that fits almost perfect. The ear jack does not line up just right but that can be fixed with an exacto blade because the hard shell is out of the way enough. I bought mine from Sqdeal but after purchasing I saw the same case available from other sellers.][Update 3 - 10/27/2015 Dropping down from 3 stars to 2 after I started using it in WIFI mode to run perk/swagbucks applications. It died after a month or two and cannot boot up. Combined with the time I spent using this as a phone I got maybe 6 months use out of it altogether. I have tried several of the Chinese knockoffs and would advocate buying a genuine older or used Samsung to save money before buying another lookalike or clone]ORIGINAL Phone review [updates in brackets]:When the reviews mentioned poor camera quality I ignored them because my camera needs are so very low. Unfortunately the main camera on this unit does not live up to even the lowest of expectations. The problem is not the resolution, which is 5M and many times more than I need, but the white-balance and exposure fills the screen with large blotches that are either whited out or too dark, what's left of the color is tinted green, blue, or pink, with a hazy rainbow border depending on how the camera is tilted, and even a flat surface has all but the specific target square fuzzy and out of focus. Using the manual settings or installing \"A Better Camera\" from the Google store makes it a little better but the help this camera needs is beyond any that can be derived from software.Other than that I liked this phone. The GPS was good. While indoors I can pick up all 8-12 satellites available to me where previous smartphones have only been able to pick up 2-4 without going outside. [UPDATE: when my new Samsung S4 Active arrived it found 25 satellites from inside the house and was able to lock onto more than half of them almost instantly leaving all prior phones in the dust.]The screen resolution may be lower than a real Note 2 but it looks fine to me with a wide clear field of vision. On the brightest setting it was as visible to me in the sunlight as any phone I have owned, although I am told some high end phones these days are better than any I have ever owned. [UPDATE: When my real Samsung arrived I found out how much a camera is truly capable of staying visible in the sunlight. This phone under review seemed tolerable at the time but I was always searching for shade. The Samsung I only need to tip it a little and according to reviews my model is on the low end for screen visibility of top end phones.]I do not think any of these multi-band secondary market phones have great mobile data speed. The data speed on my Airvoice (AT&T MVNO) connection tested at ~365kbps for me which would certainly be frustrating to a youtube addiction but plenty fast to Google up an address on the road or check email. To minimize data needs I set apps to never sync or sync on WIFI only and have email set to download on demand with just the headers unless it is something that needs to be opened. Other than that I save my power browsing for WIFI which gets more ubiquitous every day.There is no battery charging indicator. The extra battery may come in handy some time and is easy to install but no free-standing charger so it needs to be in the phone to charge. Battery life seemed normal with the phone standing by but as soon as I started actively engaging doing searches and trying to get the camera working it seemed to draw down rather quickly.[EDIT: Subsequent to leaving this review I neglected to turn off the GPS while leaving the phone charging in the car. After about a half hour I returned to the vehicle and found the the phone had tripped the Android alert for overheating. It had only been a half hour and the temperature was only 70F outside so it was unexpected. I have installed a logging app to keep an eye on the phone and will update if it turns out to be an issue}The configuration of the SIM card mounting is slightly different than the photos and at first seemed to jam up but once I followed the diagram imprinted on the phone it slid right into place.The stylus comes in handy for blocking the hole made for it but does not seem to work on the screen well enough to give up on finger poking.The spare cover looked good to me at first but the added screen protector flap would get in the way putting it into the dash stand when using for GPS. There was a transparent screen protector shipped with the device which I managed to install with only a dozen bubbles or so.The phone feels good to me and I like the mechanical \"Home\" button. I would be willing to spend some money to upgrade the camera if possible but it would probably entail tearing into the circuit board.\n",

      "I've only just received this phone a day ago, so I am still fiddling with it. Some small issues so far, such as - I have been unable find an N7100 case that actually will fit properly, the mic and headphone jack openings do not match the device. The included stylus does not work properly with the screen and there is no way to re-calibrate it, screen seems to work better with my finger. And, while it is great to include the extra battery, there is no included external charger, so it is useless to swap them. Unless, of course, you manage to find a compatible charger sold separately. Last issue, even though my carrier offers 4g service, I have yet to get 3g reception (this phone is suppose to be capable of 3g) even in the heart of town near the carrier's tower.On the good side, the phone was not $500 - $800 as you would expect to pay for Samsung's Galaxy Note II. I love the quality and functionality of Samsung's Galaxy line, but simply cannot afford the prices. As such, I will learn to live with this knock-off's flaws.\n",

Couple of details: the phone does not come with a charger only the cable, chargers are cheap at amazon, the other is that while this a Verizon phone I went to Cricket, they are owned by AT&T so they use their towers and got 2.5 GB of data and unlimited voice and text for 35 bucks with auto pay, AT&T is not Verizon but its good enough for me.

The color is cute and the size is perfect; I love the new chargers, I got this phone after having an iPhone 4 and the charger was always breaking on me so this was a nice change. As paranoid as I am about dropping iPhones ( since I had a iPhone 4) I did drop this a few times before I could get a case and was pleasantly surprised that the screen held up! One thing I dislike about Apple products is the headphones, they are way too big for my ears and don't have good connectivity so I never use them and I feel as if they're going to waste! I did pass this phone onto my mother for an upgrade but I was also surprised when my mother ( a 50 year old non- tech savvy woman) came to me and told me she loved it as well! She found some of the apps to be too much but after she got the hang of how everything worked she really enjoyed it. She very much loves to use the FaceTime option.\n",

      "This may seem really ridiculous but I ordered this last week and got it Saturday. Before I got it activated the other night the screen was messing up on me. I was having a lot of fun trying to put in my WiFi information. Anyway, I got it activated last night and everything was working fine. But now it's back to the way it was before it was activated. The screen was acting like it was possessed or a chipmunk on rd caffeine. It kept going to comments or my messages or previous pages on the Facebook app and it even did it on the Safari app when I decided to just use Facebook on that. Still acted up. I was really looking forward to trying out Apple but I'm really disappointed. Even with that 9.0.2 update or whatever it is, it's still doing it. The phone itself is great but that touchscreen thing, REALLY needs to be fixed. As well as on their future models. The only other positive thing I can say is that it finally showed my music than my previous phone did (not an iPhone). It would show less than half of it even though it was all right on the micro SD card I had in it.I will try Apple again someday when it gets better hopefully. If not, it's either just not meant for me, I got a lemon, or I should just curse the fact that I have big fingers. Lol.\n",

      "I purchased this phone after not reading thoroughly, from another vendor and ended up with an unlocked iPhone incompatible with my carrier/ provider. Although disappointing, it was totally my fault. Luckily, I was able to return that phone and purchase this one. It is very important to educate yourself and read all of the product description before purchasing something like this. Although The previous vendor I worked with was fantastic with the return and refund process, I could've save myself the hassle if I just paid attention. Moving on, this phone is fantastic. It is completely functional, and works better than a previous iPhone I had purchased brand-new. If you are buying this iPhone and have not previously owned an iPhone, you will need to purchase a Sim card to activate this phone. You can get them for a small charge at your local Carrier/Provider/Apple store, or you can just order one here and save yourself the hassle. Again make sure the Sim card is appropriate to your carrier/ provider.I see some top rated reviews here indicating not to trust the seller. I have to say that the seller was absolutely phenomenal, everything arrived in tiptop condition and in all original packaging, with Apple certified charger and earbuds. I really couldn't be happier with the purchase. Just remember, be specific about your carrier. Also remember, unlocked does not mean compatible with server. Any refurbished iPhone you purchase will be unlocked, but if you have a Verizon carrier get a Verizon compatible phone, same with AT&T, Sprint, or whatever the case may be. The same goes with the Sim card, make sure it is compatible with your carrier. I cannot emphasize this enough.\n",

I am a major clutz and have dropped my phone on the daily since I received it, but as it's been in the case during those drops it has sustained only one major screen shatter- when it dropped out of my pocket from two stories above ground.If you are familiar with apple, and want a reliable phone that is an older model, this is the way to go. Also according to my seventeen year old brother, it is a great starting phone.I'd Highly recommend.\n",

      "It's been @ least 2 months since I've had my new iPhone! When I say this phone that I'm doing this review on, is soooooo amazing!!! It's get 5 starts in all areas I can think about! The phone came in a timetable manner and the seller was VERY nice, she was amazing with giving me information on where my package was and etc.! Not only that but the phone came very clean and absolutely NO cracks or even scratches. It looked brand new and the speed on the phone is outstanding, battery life lasts all day I would find myself charging my phone only twice a day if I was on it from morning to before I went to bed. Now the phone came with JUST the phone no charger or headphones but that was no problem for me. I brought a charger the same day and I already had a pair of headphones from a friend with an IPhone! But overall if your having second thought you shouldn't because this was the best order I've had in years!! Thanks and much love 💕😊\n",

      "Update: I am not blaming the vendor, but I did purchase an internally damaged phone from Cellular Trendz.Over a year ago I bought a white iPhone 5c on here from \"WeSellCellular\" and the phone was great and at a great price. I needed another cheap 5c so I got a green one from Cellular Trendz. Everything was fine except the battery life lasted a few hours even without me touching the phone. I am tech savvy and I've done numerous iPhone repairs myself so I bought a reputable battery here on Amazon. I opened the phone and I noticed one of the water damage indicators was red. Red= water damaged, white = never been exposed to water. I checked the other internal water damage indicator and it was also red. One of the screws that holds the battery connector in place was missing, but, it gets worse. There are RICE GRAINS inside the phone!! Not one or two random unidentifiable crumbs but multiple rice grains lodged in crevices of the phone. This leads me to believe someone water damaged the phone, removed the battery, and stuck it in rice.Good for a backup phone or someone who really wants an iPhone while on a budget. However, with the latest iOS 9 update this phone is slower than ever! Try and get one with iOS 8.4 or prior, but for long-term use I would go for a newer model.\n",

      "Purchased from Bobcat Wireless and received a great Refurbished phone. Came in generic packaging, but had an Apple charger. Setup was tricky at Verizon but the dude got it done. This phone is basically an iphone 5 in Color...which is what the C stands for. It does not have Fingerprint Sensor or some of the added camera specs of the 5s, but for normal, daytime pix, this phone is great. The exterior is a tough plastic exterior around aluminum. The size is nice. If you are like me and can't stand the thought of holding a tablet to your ear, you will like the size and feel of this phone. The color is great. I bought this for my son, but honestly, I had a hard time handing it over. The green phone is a tad lighter than standard Minecraft green. Fellow geeks will understand. I went with 32GB. I don't recommend going with anything less unless you have the restraint to use only a handful of apps. I wish this phone had offered the 64GB option. This phone is fast. It moves seamlessly from songs to apps, etc. Apparently you have to set Siri up on this phone. I'll deal with that another day. But, very satisfied with this seller and phone. The phone did work with Verizon, although unlocked. And, the iCloud and iTunes information from the previous owner was completely deleted.\n",

      "I purchased the phone from \"WeSellCellular\" listed in Good condition. I am more than pleased!! It is for my sister who breaks her phones like crazy. I did not want to spend a lot of money and this seemed like a great price for 32GB! It is from Verizon but it's factory unlocked- worked great with a T-Mobile SIM card and a Cricket SIM card (both got LTE).It got here in only 3 days or so (ordered Sunday night arrived Wednesday). The condition is much better than I imagined! Personally, I would list this phone as Excellent or mint. It's perfect except for one tiny scratch near the power button.The screen is in PERFECT condition with no scratches. I put a TechArmor glass screen protector on it and also an Otterbox Commuter.It came with a charger and sync cable which work as they should.The phone came with iOS 8.1.1 which was perfect for jailbreaking.Clean IMEI, no iCloud lock.\n",

I was so bummed... Even though I am a long-time Verizon customer (10 years now), I decided to keep the phone and just try AT&Ts service for a little while - oh my, what a BIG MISTAKE. To make a long, very negative story short and sweet, I ended up buying a VERIZON iPhone just like this one (blue, too) and IMMEDIATELY took my service back to Verizon; they only charge me $45 a month without a contract anyway. BUT... when my bill came from AT&T (only 3 weeks into my new service), they wanted almost $67 from me after telling me it would only be $45 from the beginning!!!! - HA - I'm not stupid and I refuse to be lied to, so that's why I changed back to Verizon with the same type of phone - because both Verizon and the PHONE rock!\n",

It also comes with a SIM port key, earbuds, a charger and the fun standard Apple icon stickers. I chose to purchase the green one, which was a fun spring green! It took two weeks to arrive at my doorstep, but the product booted just fine and worked for about a month. The processing is much faster than the iPhone 4, but in comparison to my mom's iPhone 6, it might just be worth waiting for the next iPhone to come out in the next couple of months. The ear piece stopped working after 32 days. I returned to the seller for a refund, but they charged me a 50% restocking fee. When it worked, the phone was nice and fun because of the color, but working with this vendor isn't worth it.\n",

Since I knew the people well at my local Verizon store, I finally convinced them to insure it. But now it won't hold the iCloud password: it is either an internal phone problem or an Apple problem. I'm probably going to trade this in for a Samsung. This was my first Apple purchase and I am very disappointed.

One thing I dislike about Apple products is the headphones, they are way too big for my ears and don't have good connectivity so I never use them and I feel as if they're going to waste! I did pass this phone onto my mother for an upgrade but I was also surprised when my mother ( a 50 year old non- tech savvy woman) came to me and told me she loved it as well!

I am NOT a technology person, and I didn't understand the \"No SIM card\" thing. I had no clue that it was a needed thing for my phone. However, I took my phone to Verizon to get it activated and they just gave me one, no problem, no charge. It was simple.THANK YOU VERY MUCH, for the great service and the phone. It was a great price for the item that I needed and I will be sure to come back to this company again for a phone in my future!:)\n",

      "This is the version of the iphone you want if you are an international traveler from the states. Either the iPhone 5, 5c, or 5S; if you don't get the factory unlocked version online, then buy the Verizon Wireless version only. Unlike AT&T and Sprint (DO NOT buy the Sprint model, they don't support enough LTE bands for international travel) Verizon sells their phones unlocked. With AT&T you have to go through a lot of red tape just to get it unlocked; not cool. If you decided to buy directly from a Verzion store, just buy the phone without a contract and go with a month-to-month plan. People think they are getting a deal on the phone by getting the 2-year contract, but in the long run, you will be spending WAAAYYY more than if you would just spend the money for the phone out right and go with a prepaid plan. You'll save a lot more money that way. Spend $500 now and have the freedom to go with any phone company you want, or spend about $2000 for the next two years? The choice is yours... >:D\n",

I was having a lot of fun trying to put in my WiFi information. Anyway, I got it activated last night and everything was working fine. But now it's back to the way it was before it was activated. The screen was acting like it was possessed or a chipmunk on rd caffeine. It kept going to comments or my messages or previous pages on the Facebook app and it even did it on the Safari app when I decided to just use Facebook on that. Still acted up. I was really looking forward to trying out Apple but I'm really disappointed. Even with that 9.0.2 update or whatever it is, it's still doing it. The phone itself is great but that touchscreen thing, REALLY needs to be fixed. As well as on their future models. The only other positive thing I can say is that it finally showed my music than my previous phone did (not an iPhone). It would show less than half of it even though it was all right on the micro SD card I had in it.I will try Apple again someday when it gets better hopefully.

      "First of all, this product sat on the shelf too long before I bought it; thus, when I took it to both Apple and Verizon to buy insurance, I was told \"the manufacturer date is too old for us to insure\", i.e., beyond 60 days. Since I knew the people well at my local Verizon store, I finally convinced them to insure it. But now it won't hold the iCloud password: it is either an internal phone problem or an Apple problem. I'm probably going to trade this in for a Samsung. This was my first Apple purchase and I am very disappointed. You may save a few bucks by buying online, but you will be better off in the long-run by buying local where the seller will stand behind their product.\n",

      "I purchased this phone after not reading thoroughly, from another vendor and ended up with an unlocked iPhone incompatible with my carrier/ provider. Although disappointing, it was totally my fault. Luckily, I was able to return that phone and purchase this one. It is very important to educate yourself and read all of the product description before purchasing something like this. Although The previous vendor I worked with was fantastic with the return and refund process, I could've save myself the hassle if I just paid attention. Moving on, this phone is fantastic. It is completely functional, and works better than a previous iPhone I had purchased brand-new. If you are buying this iPhone and have not previously owned an iPhone, you will need to purchase a Sim card to activate this phone. You can get them for a small charge at your local Carrier/Provider/Apple store, or you can just order one here and save yourself the hassle. Again make sure the Sim card is appropriate to your carrier/ provider.I see some top rated reviews here indicating not to trust the seller. I have to say that the seller was absolutely phenomenal, everything arrived in tiptop condition and in all original packaging, with Apple certified charger and earbuds. I really couldn't be happier with the purchase. Just remember, be specific about your carrier. Also remember, unlocked does not mean compatible with server. Any refurbished iPhone you purchase will be unlocked, but if you have a Verizon carrier get a Verizon compatible phone, same with AT&T, Sprint, or whatever the case may be. The same goes with the Sim card, make sure it is compatible with your carrier. I cannot emphasize this enough.\n",

      "The apple Iphone 5c in blue, has been my go to phone for the past year. I absolutely love the lightweight feel, and the ease of carry.However without a case this phone is very easily broken. I am a major clutz and have dropped my phone on the daily since I received it, but as it's been in the case during those drops it has sustained only one major screen shatter- when it dropped out of my pocket from two stories above ground.If you are familiar with apple, and want a reliable phone that is an older model, this is the way to go. Also according to my seventeen year old brother, it is a great starting phone.I'd Highly recommend.\n",

      "It's been @ least 2 months since I've had my new iPhone! When I say this phone that I'm doing this review on, is soooooo amazing!!! It's get 5 starts in all areas I can think about! The phone came in a timetable manner and the seller was VERY nice, she was amazing with giving me information on where my package was and etc.! Not only that but the phone came very clean and absolutely NO cracks or even scratches. It looked brand new and the speed on the phone is outstanding, battery life lasts all day I would find myself charging my phone only twice a day if I was on it from morning to before I went to bed. Now the phone came with JUST the phone no charger or headphones but that was no problem for me. I brought a charger the same day and I already had a pair of headphones from a friend with an IPhone! But overall if your having second thought you shouldn't because this was the best order I've had in years!! Thanks and much love 💕😊\n",

The condition is much better than I imagined! Personally, I would list this phone as Excellent or mint. It's perfect except for one tiny scratch near the power button.The screen is in PERFECT condition with no scratches.

      "Purchased from Bobcat Wireless and received a great Refurbished phone. Came in generic packaging, but had an Apple charger. Setup was tricky at Verizon but the dude got it done. This phone is basically an iphone 5 in Color...which is what the C stands for. It does not have Fingerprint Sensor or some of the added camera specs of the 5s, but for normal, daytime pix, this phone is great. The exterior is a tough plastic exterior around aluminum. The size is nice. If you are like me and can't stand the thought of holding a tablet to your ear, you will like the size and feel of this phone. The color is great. I bought this for my son, but honestly, I had a hard time handing it over. The green phone is a tad lighter than standard Minecraft green. Fellow geeks will understand. I went with 32GB. I don't recommend going with anything less unless you have the restraint to use only a handful of apps. I wish this phone had offered the 64GB option. This phone is fast. It moves seamlessly from songs to apps, etc. Apparently you have to set Siri up on this phone. I'll deal with that another day. But, very satisfied with this seller and phone. The phone did work with Verizon, although unlocked. And, the iCloud and iTunes information from the previous owner was completely deleted.\n",

      "Update: I am not blaming the vendor, but I did purchase an internally damaged phone from Cellular Trendz.Over a year ago I bought a white iPhone 5c on here from \"WeSellCellular\" and the phone was great and at a great price. I needed another cheap 5c so I got a green one from Cellular Trendz. Everything was fine except the battery life lasted a few hours even without me touching the phone. I am tech savvy and I've done numerous iPhone repairs myself so I bought a reputable battery here on Amazon. I opened the phone and I noticed one of the water damage indicators was red. Red= water damaged, white = never been exposed to water. I checked the other internal water damage indicator and it was also red. One of the screws that holds the battery connector in place was missing, but, it gets worse. There are RICE GRAINS inside the phone!! Not one or two random unidentifiable crumbs but multiple rice grains lodged in crevices of the phone. This leads me to believe someone water damaged the phone, removed the battery, and stuck it in rice.Good for a backup phone or someone who really wants an iPhone while on a budget. However, with the latest iOS 9 update this phone is slower than ever! Try and get one with iOS 8.4 or prior, but for long-term use I would go for a newer model.\n",

The color is cute and the size is perfect; I love the new chargers, I got this phone after having an iPhone 4 and the charger was always breaking on me so this was a nice change. As paranoid as I am about dropping iPhones ( since I had a iPhone 4) I did drop this a few times before I could get a case and was pleasantly surprised that the screen held up! One thing I dislike about Apple products is the headphones, they are way too big for my ears and don't have good connectivity so I never use them and I feel as if they're going to waste! I did pass this phone onto my mother for an upgrade but I was also surprised when my mother ( a 50 year old non- tech savvy woman) came to me and told me she loved it as well! She found some of the apps to be too much but after she got the hang of how everything worked she really enjoyed it. She very much loves to use the FaceTime option.\n",

      "I purchased this phone after not reading thoroughly, from another vendor and ended up with an unlocked iPhone incompatible with my carrier/ provider. Although disappointing, it was totally my fault. Luckily, I was able to return that phone and purchase this one. It is very important to educate yourself and read all of the product description before purchasing something like this. Although The previous vendor I worked with was fantastic with the return and refund process, I could've save myself the hassle if I just paid attention. Moving on, this phone is fantastic. It is completely functional, and works better than a previous iPhone I had purchased brand-new. If you are buying this iPhone and have not previously owned an iPhone, you will need to purchase a Sim card to activate this phone. You can get them for a small charge at your local Carrier/Provider/Apple store, or you can just order one here and save yourself the hassle. Again make sure the Sim card is appropriate to your carrier/ provider.I see some top rated reviews here indicating not to trust the seller. I have to say that the seller was absolutely phenomenal, everything arrived in tiptop condition and in all original packaging, with Apple certified charger and earbuds. I really couldn't be happier with the purchase. Just remember, be specific about your carrier. Also remember, unlocked does not mean compatible with server. Any refurbished iPhone you purchase will be unlocked, but if you have a Verizon carrier get a Verizon compatible phone, same with AT&T, Sprint, or whatever the case may be. The same goes with the Sim card, make sure it is compatible with your carrier. I cannot emphasize this enough.\n",

      "I absolutely LOVE the phone, however, it was advertised as a VERIZON phone but when I received it and tried using it through my Verizon account, I was told by the customer rep that the phone I bought was for AT&T - not Verizon!!! I was so bummed... Even though I am a long-time Verizon customer (10 years now), I decided to keep the phone and just try AT&Ts service for a little while - oh my, what a BIG MISTAKE. To make a long, very negative story short and sweet, I ended up buying a VERIZON iPhone just like this one (blue, too) and IMMEDIATELY took my service back to Verizon; they only charge me $45 a month without a contract anyway. BUT... when my bill came from AT&T (only 3 weeks into my new service), they wanted almost $67 from me after telling me it would only be $45 from the beginning!!!! - HA - I'm not stupid and I refuse to be lied to, so that's why I changed back to Verizon with the same type of phone - because both Verizon and the PHONE rock!\n",

      "The standing joke about the Apple iPhone 5c is that the \"c\" stands for \"cheap,\" not \"color.\" The phone came with a sim card that you'll have to take to the Verizon store to activate. It also comes with a SIM port key, earbuds, a charger and the fun standard Apple icon stickers. I chose to purchase the green one, which was a fun spring green! It took two weeks to arrive at my doorstep, but the product booted just fine and worked for about a month. The processing is much faster than the iPhone 4, but in comparison to my mom's iPhone 6, it might just be worth waiting for the next iPhone to come out in the next couple of months. The ear piece stopped working after 32 days. I returned to the seller for a refund, but they charged me a 50% restocking fee. When it worked, the phone was nice and fun because of the color, but working with this vendor isn't worth it.\n",

The seller was at first sarcastic about the time it took for me to notice that the phone was not unlocked, but changed his tone when I provided a link from DHL showing the date I received my total order in the Caribbean. I refused to returned the phone, because restocking fees alone would have cost me $ 200.00. I decided to keep it, jailbreak it when one becomes available and give it to my wife. The seller claims that additional information was given about the phone. I spend two days reading all the details about this seller, plus the comments and ratings from previous customers.

After researching the problem and tryin everything it was clearly a bad battery.I paid to return it and the seller emailed me to say a replacement was sent. When I received the replacement clearly it was the same phone as I had forgotten to remove the screen protector. What's worse. The battery life now was less than 1hoir usage straight out of the box after full 7hr recharge from the wall adapter and no added apps.So I decided rather than waste any more money shipping back to this incompetent repair center I'd just buy the battery replace kit and do it myself!wish I'd spent the little extra to get at the Apple Store now.\n",

Customer service guaranteed me that still the phone was new and not refurbished and I was sticking with that, as really everything else seemed like new.Another small thing which is odd: this phone has Chinese preinstalled as language in all apps and many sub menus. Although changing the primary language to English it was not possible to remove Chinese completely as a language. I tried to get around that by installing Spanish as a second language so Chinese is now only third. Nevertheless Chinese signs keep popping up from time to time on the phone.\n",

The battery life now was less than 1hoir usage straight out of the box after full 7hr recharge from the wall adapter and no added apps.So I decided rather than waste any more money shipping back to this incompetent repair center I'd just buy the battery replace kit and do it myself!wish I'd spent the little extra to get at the Apple Store now.\n",

I went to Apple, and they said that they couldn't replace the defective phone because all the parts weren't Apple. The back was fake, and too small for the phone to sit flush in.

      "I bought the iPhone 6 Gold 64GB from Wireless Warehouse. It was said to be in excellent condition I picked it up for about $400. I get the phone, overall it was in good condition. It had one little ding on the bottom right nothing too noticeable. After using it for about 2 days I noticed the battery life was absolutely dreadful. Luckily, the firmware was on 9.3.3 so it could be jailbroken. I jailbroke the iPhone I downloaded a tweak to give me information about my battery life it's at ~40-60% capacity it likes to jump around, it had over 800 charges. The iPhone was used a lot I could tell. So I am going to order an external battery and take apart the phone. Now if anyone else has a bad battery and they need to switch it out I recommend you go with extreme caution. If you're not comfortable with doing it then I highly recommend you don't do it. If you can pay apple their fee (which I think is roughly $100) then I would do that. However, I don't really feel apple should get $100 for a battery you can pick up for $20. But again I am fairly comfortable with taking apart my phone. Overall I am happy about the phone I will update later once I order the battery and get it put in.\n",

I had to make sure it was the T-Mobile version also due to the varying bands (900/1800/2100, etc) that only T-Mobile uses.This phone runs fast, works well, holds the best battery life to date, and works reallly well. I tested the phone out before I gifted it to my girlfriend and it is steps above her old iPhone. Great replacement and worth the cost.As a note for those looking for a compatible T-Mobile iPhone 6, ensure that the box/label says \"A1649\" as the model.

      "I bought the iPhone 6 Gold 64GB from Wireless Warehouse. It was said to be in excellent condition I picked it up for about $400. I get the phone, overall it was in good condition. It had one little ding on the bottom right nothing too noticeable. After using it for about 2 days I noticed the battery life was absolutely dreadful. Luckily, the firmware was on 9.3.3 so it could be jailbroken. I jailbroke the iPhone I downloaded a tweak to give me information about my battery life it's at ~40-60% capacity it likes to jump around, it had over 800 charges. The iPhone was used a lot I could tell. So I am going to order an external battery and take apart the phone. Now if anyone else has a bad battery and they need to switch it out I recommend you go with extreme caution. If you're not comfortable with doing it then I highly recommend you don't do it. If you can pay apple their fee (which I think is roughly $100) then I would do that. However, I don't really feel apple should get $100 for a battery you can pick up for $20. But again I am fairly comfortable with taking apart my phone. Overall I am happy about the phone I will update later once I order the battery and get it put in.\n",

I went to Apple, and they said that they couldn't replace the defective phone because all the parts weren't Apple. The back was fake, and too small for the phone to sit flush in. I had to return it, and three days after it reached them, I filed a complaint because they didn't refund my money. Amazon was able to get my refund, thankfully.

Just got it in the mail and have been setting it up for the better part of the afternoon. I am happy with it so far, seems to work like new. I got the 128GB because I previously had only 16GB on my old iPad. I kept running out of space which was incredibly frustrating, in the last year I have had to back up to my PC twice and clear everything from the iPad. It was time consuming double checking that every one of my thousands of pictures and videos made it onto my computer/flash drive before deleting from the iPad. I literally spent hours. So I'm very glad I decided to purchase the one with the largest storage capacity this time. I expect it will save me a lot of headaches down the road as I take more photos and videos.\n",

I got the 128GB because I previously had only 16GB on my old iPad. I kept running out of space which was incredibly frustrating, in the last year I have had to back up to my PC twice and clear everything from the iPad. It was time consuming double checking that every one of my thousands of pictures and videos made it onto my computer/flash drive before deleting from the iPad. I literally spent hours. So I'm very glad I decided to purchase the one with the largest storage capacity this time. I expect it will save me a lot of headaches down the road as I take more photos and videos.\n",

Just got it in the mail and have been setting it up for the better part of the afternoon. I am happy with it so far, seems to work like new. I got the 128GB because I previously had only 16GB on my old iPad. I kept running out of space which was incredibly frustrating, in the last year I have had to back up to my PC twice and clear everything from the iPad. It was time consuming double checking that every one of my thousands of pictures and videos made it onto my computer/flash drive before deleting from the iPad. I literally spent hours. So I'm very glad I decided to purchase the one with the largest storage capacity this time. I expect it will save me a lot of headaches down the road as I take more photos and videos.\n",

      "Worst iPhone ever. Do not buy this phone, it's more of a paperweight than a phone. There are so many problems with the 3g. The iOS is 4.2.1 which basically means that there are very few apps for this phone. Can't get any of the major apps like Facebook, Twitter, Google+, YouTube, Amazon, Pinterest, and so fourth. Most of the apps are for iOS 6.0 and above. It took me days to actually finds some apps by searching the internet. The phone has a static sound when making a phone call & it is hard to hear the person on the other end. Surfing on the internet is so slow and it takes pages too long to load, my cheap tablet is faster than this phone. Now on to the problems with my phone. It makes a weird clicking noise when I unlock the phone. My phone was attached to another account when I tried to download music, had to erase the phone and start over. I can't get apps in the app store on the phone because it has another email attached to the phone, so if I wanted to get apps, I have to go to iTunes and add the apps from there. Tried to contact the seller to return the phone and never received a reply. Going to reset the phone back to factory settings to turn it into an iPod or back up phone. My advice is to purchase an iPhone 4s or higher if you have the money, even a 3gs would be better or just get a Samsung phone. It would be a good backup phone to have, a good iPod player, a good digital picture frame,or to give to a child with some games to play. But as an actual phone, stay away.\n",

PROBLEMS::::THE CASE HAS MANY SCRATCHES ON THE BACK OF IT,BUT IF THAT WAS THE ONLY ISSUE I WOULD NOT BE CONTACTING YOU. ***THE PHONE IS JUNK!! THE PHONE HAS BEEN JAIL BROKE AND WAS USED WITH ANOTHER CARRIER,(SUCH AS TEAM MOBILE). I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FOR MY TEENAGE DAUGHTERS 15th BIRTHDAY. WE DID NOT TRY TO HAVE THE PHONE ACTIVATED AS SOON AS WE RECEIVED IT, BECAUSE HER BIRTHDAY WAS A WEEK LATER. AFTER SHE OPENED THE WRAPPED UP PHONE ON HER BIRTHDAY, WITH ALL HER FRIENDS (Her Gift from us-Mom and Dad),THE NEXT DAY WE TOOK HER AND HER PHONE TO OUR LOCAL CORPORATE AT&T STORE TO HAVE THE PHONE ACTIVATED, THEY ATTEMPTED (for over 2.5 long Hours!!) TO ACTIVATE THIS PHONE. IT WOULD NOT ACCEPT THE AT&T INFO AND PROGRAM TO ACTIVATE IT AND WORK. THEY THEN SENT ME TO THE APPLE STORE AT THE SHOPPING MALL (which was over an hour away!) I had to wait 2.5 hours while a technician looked at the phone and ran test to see whether or not the phone could be activated...***THE FINAL DECISION WAS THAT THE PHONE HAD BEEN TAMPERED WITH INTERNALLY AND HAD BEEN JAIL BROKEN TO ACCEPT ANOTHER CARRIER AND WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO BE RESTORED OR REASSIGNED TO AT&T!!!! I FEEL THAT YOU KNEW THAT THERE WAS AN INTERNAL ISSUE AND YOU TOOK ADVANTAGE OF ME AND TOOK MY MONEY KNOWING GOOD AND WELL THAT THE PHONE COULD NEVER BE RESTORED ACTIVATED BY ANOTHER CARRIER!!!! *** ***UPDATE...I forgot to mention that the phone was listed here on Amazon, as a 16gb, and it turned out when the tech at Apple ran the test on the phone, it was determined that not only was the phone junk...it was an 8gb. phone, not a 16gb. as the Seller and Amazon had listed!!! again...Beware!!! I AM REALLY PISSED AND THE FACT THAT YOU MADE US LOOK LIKE AN ASS TO OUR DAUGHTER, AS SHE CRIED AND WAS VERY UPSET ABOUT THE PHONE NOT WORKING AND NOW SHE STILL DOES NOT HAVE A PHONE!!! AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF, WE BOUGHT A $60.00 DOLLAR OTTER BOX TO PUT THE PHONE IN TO PROTECT IT!! SO NOW I AM OUT $172.99 PLUS ALL MY WASTED TIME AND GAS!!! BECAUSE OF THIS EXPERIENCE....I WOULD ADVISE ANY AND ALL PROSPECTIVE BUYS TO STEER CLEAR FROM THIS SELLER AND ALL AMAZONS USED PHONES AS THEY ARE LIKE CROOKS,SCAM ARTIST AND A LAIRS!!!!!!!!!!

      "I purchsed this phone because I wanted to see what it was like in the \"iPhone\" world. Well, let's just say I learned my lesson and I've came to the conclusion that I'd rather have a good ole' Samsung. The phone was NOT unlocked when I got it, I had to pay to have a guy at an authorized dealer unlock it for me. When he unlocked the phone my contacts and my photos disappeared. He really unlocked it_@ this point I had to start from scratch as if the phone was brand new. After speaking with 2 people at TMobile about operating iTunes, I went to download my apps (some of which I pay monthly for) I was informed that my iPhone 3 was not compatible. So at this point, I've put out more money than I anticipated, including the apps that I pay monthly for, and I can't do anything but talk and text. Even picture messaging takes forever and I have to ask for a wifi password everything I go. This was devastating because I really didn't want to request a refund simply because the seller was nice. I advise anyone who's planning to purchase an iPhone 3, DON'T. Just take a step up and spend a little more to get a newer model to prevent yourself from going through what I'm going through. Everything was good when I purchased the phone, I even received the phone in a timely mannerut as soon as I placed my SIM into the device, it was downhill from there. It's just a huge inconvenience.

Lack of clarity of the product itself due to misliding information: on the amazon page it was presented as iPhone 3GS and in reality it was iPhone 3G.2. During initialization the latest release of telephone software from I tunes blocked the phone as not \"apple official unlocked iPhone\".3. As I bring my iPhone to Italy, and return the phone by courrier was diffult I brought the phone for unlocking again to a specialized operator. During the unlocking operation from the serail number it appeared that the iphone was not new but already retured back from the market.4. After one month of work the screen stopped to work and now it remains dark.5. I pull back my old phone in operations\n",

      "For a purchase from the Buying CompanyGood points:- The product matched the description, Black iPhone 3Gs 16gb, unlocked, with earphones, power adapter and USB cable.- Good price,- It was nice of the seller to throw in a charger adapter, a USB cable, and new earphones (although not apple earphones but copies, without the answer button).Bad points and reasons for 3 stars only:- Most importantly, the \"expedited 1-3 day\" shipping is sort of a joke. I received my iPhone 7 days after ordering it (including a weekend). It was sent by road and feels like it is not worth more than the cheaper regular shipping. \"1-3 day\" sounds like a lie, expecially since the box said \"UPS 3-day shipping\", so no chance to blessed with a 1-day delivery. The reason I am picky on this is because I bought this to recover from a broken phone and was without a phone during the time of delivery, making me very impatient when (1) the phone was not sent on a Saturday when I ordered on a Friday, and (2) I could track the phone slowly making its way from Dallas TX to Washington DC), from Monday to Thursday.- The iPhone was supposed to be \"used-very good\" but it had some features that didn't quite match that standard. Most importantly, the mute button on the iPhone, known to get defective after some time was already broken when I received the phone. Other than that, the phone looks goods with very few scratches (the back side of the power entry, another recurrent defect, is not crack, which is good).- The iPhone was not restored when I received it. It had the Cydia app on it, meaning it is jailbroken, which is not something I expected, nor something I think a sold iPhone should have (although legal now).\n",

      "I purchsed this phone because I wanted to see what it was like in the \"iPhone\" world. Well, let's just say I learned my lesson and I've came to the conclusion that I'd rather have a good ole' Samsung. The phone was NOT unlocked when I got it, I had to pay to have a guy at an authorized dealer unlock it for me. When he unlocked the phone my contacts and my photos disappeared. He really unlocked it_@ this point I had to start from scratch as if the phone was brand new. After speaking with 2 people at TMobile about operating iTunes, I went to download my apps (some of which I pay monthly for) I was informed that my iPhone 3 was not compatible. So at this point, I've put out more money than I anticipated, including the apps that I pay monthly for, and I can't do anything but talk and text. Even picture messaging takes forever and I have to ask for a wifi password everything I go. This was devastating because I really didn't want to request a refund simply because the seller was nice. I advise anyone who's planning to purchase an iPhone 3, DON'T. Just take a step up and spend a little more to get a newer model to prevent yourself from going through what I'm going through. Everything was good when I purchased the phone, I even received the phone in a timely mannerut as soon as I placed my SIM into the device, it was downhill from there. It's just a huge inconvenience.

That was my fault, and because its an older model. and is on the newest firmware; the battery life is not all that great. 7 hours of use before it dies.Other reviews state that this company is shipping 3G phones instead of 3Gs.At first i thought the same thing until I called my carrear, and gave them the model number. They confirmed it was 3GS.Pros.Item arrived extremly quickly :-)As advertised it was brand new in box un-opened. :-)With moderate use, without the use of GPS, or downloading apps. Canging settings from 3G to 2G noticably increases the battery life.Over all i am extremly happy with my purchase.\n",

Other reviews were full of lists that didnt work, but I tried them on the 3gs I got recently and the ones that didnt work were usually ones I didnt expect to work. Youtube,bbc News, Google Maps, GPS apps, Amazon Prime video, kindle books. All of these apps worked fine with no errors. As well as Final Fantasy Dimensions. I would expect most games not to work in this, but the only ones I've tried are FFD and Bejeweled which work fine.

He was very quick and responsive to my needs and I am very pleased. I also put new battery in phone works great!

      "I ordered the phone as a bday gift for my son. It got here on time but the battery in the phone was defective. The phone would die completely if the phone's battery reached half-life. I contact the company to get a battery. Living overseas it is not easy replacing a battery for this model and when I purchased it I thought I was purchasing a \"working\" iphone. That was four months ago with no response from the company. Last week the phone did one better, it stopped charging completely and the touch screen literally exploded from the inside out. Although this phone has been in a draw in a protective case for a month when my son was no longer grounded we gave it back to him the touch screen as completely disconnected itself from the phone while the body of the phone was still in the protective case. My son tried to press the screen back into the body of the phone and then the screen cracked. This was a waste of money and time he never got a full months use out of the thing, we were better off just buying him a cheap prepaid phone at least it would have worked.\n",

      "The 3G is really, really slow. I didn't want to sign a contract, but I needed a new phone. Perhaps the 3GS is slow compared with the 4 and 4s, but it's plenty fast for everything I need it to do, and being able to pick it up for the price Amazon Warehouse Deals offers it for and not having to sign a contract made this an excellent purchase. My only complaint is that the silence switch is a little wonky, but it is a minor complaint, given that the unit shipped with an immaculate back and screen, and with a sync cable, earbuds, and a wall charger. Highly recommended for those wanting to upgrade from the aging 3G but are wary of signing a new contract with AT&T.\n",

So, I thought why not try out the iphone 3gs, I'd heard good things about it, so I thought I would buy one. I choose to buy it online because everybody knows at&t's prices are ridiculous. So I bought the phone expecting not to get much for only $270. Boy, was I wrong. I got the phone in a nicely wrapped package and they even included a charger. Unfortunately, the phone was locked. But that was not a big problem, I took it to my nearest at&t store and got my number transfered to a new sim card for the phone. All in all I am very happy with my purchase. The phone only had a small scuff mark on the back and the battery is in marvelous condition.\n",

The quality was very good, battery holds well, screen was pristine and there were very minor scuffs and scratches on the back (which should be expected on a used piece).

The only thing that let me know that the phone was used was that the port where the charger goes and the speakers had gotten a little dusty. So, in short, the phone arrived in like-new condition.As for the phone itself, it's worked fine for me so far. I've been using it for about two weeks now, and I haven't encountered any problems. The only complaints I have are about AT&T and their service, not the phone itself. It bears repeating that if you get this phone, it's not unlocked and you're stuck with AT&T.

I would highly recommend this seller and the product to my friends!After 3 months: The iphone still works, but it started to freeze randomly. Sometimes it shutsdown eventhough the battery is at 80 to 100%. It doesn't turn on, no matter what you do. Then somehow, it randomly turns on after 30 to 40 mins. Since I am a technician, I would say it is the case of refurbrished items. It is not the \"brand new\" item as listed. At my best guess, I would say these are the refurbrished items that are left over from carriers such as AT&T and verizon and later sold to third party sellers. CHEAP BUSINESS!

That was my fault, and because its an older model. and is on the newest firmware; the battery life is not all that great. 7 hours of use before it dies.Other reviews state that this company is shipping 3G phones instead of 3Gs.At first i thought the same thing until I called my carrear, and gave them the model number. They confirmed it was 3GS.Pros.Item arrived extremly quickly :-)As advertised it was brand new in box un-opened. :-)With moderate use, without the use of GPS, or downloading apps. Canging settings from 3G to 2G noticably increases the battery life.Over all i am extremly happy with my purchase.\n",

Youtube,bbc News, Google Maps, GPS apps, Amazon Prime video, kindle books. All of these apps worked fine with no errors. As well as Final Fantasy Dimensions. I would expect most games not to work in this, but the only ones I've tried are FFD and Bejeweled which work fine.

      "New update- I should have just returned this piece of crap. It no longer functions unless it is plugged in. It turns off constantly from something as simple as I am typing a text and receive a text at the same time. not pictures, just text, and the phone is not loaded up with anything, I don't have games or videos. It is simply a garbage phone. I did not heed the waning signs, I really wanted it to work, but alas, it doesn't.Update - I did not get a chance to change back over to my old cracked phone, but in the meantime I left the new one on a charger for a whole day and now it seems to be working fine. Perhaps they should include an instruction to do this before using the phone (although, I have never had another phone glitch out like that and not want to charge or take a full day to complete one full charge, so it still makes me think twice about keeping it)... For now I am updating my review to 3 stars and keeping the phone because I just don't have the energy to go through another 3rd party seller return. Hopefully I don't regret it...Just received this phone and in the last 24 hours it doesn't seem to get to full charge no matter how long it is plugged in. It has also turned off randomly at least 25 times during use and you turn it back on and it turns off a few more times before staying on for a couple hours, but as soon as it is being used to do anything it glitches and turns off within a few minutes. All I've done is text on it and read a few online articles, I don't even have apps or a ton of stored things, so no reason to glitch like this.\n",

To make this even more special amazon sells these phones and apple doesnt or other companies since semtember 2012 these iphones are for sale in store. In the package came the Iphone itself, a sim card removal tool, New Earphones, and a New USB connector. Overall I am happy with this iphone until IOS 7 comes out then i will upgrade.\n",

Exceptional service.The phone is worse than worthless.I used to think apple products were better because I never owned any of them.I wanted to find out if iPhones were really as good as people say they are.I've been a programmer, technician, electronic engineer, satellite communications specialist, phone network specialist, and datacenter network management specialist, before I retired in 2001, and I figured out how to do everything I want with android phones easily when I got my first one in 2010.I couldn't do anything with this.First I had to drive all over the city to find a sim card because it won't even let you use it on wifi without one and it took hours of trying different places because apple changes stuff like that with every new model just so their customers can't keep using their old accessories when they buy a new phone.When I got into it I couldn't get it to do anything.It was perfectly functional but it wouldn't do anything I wanted to do. Even the simplest things I do easily on every windows android or Linux device I've ever used.Of course every Microsoft OS has been extremely badly designed and Android sucks in its own ways, and haven't used Linux enough to have an opinion about it.But ios is the worst I've ever seen.With that and the nonremovable battery which will stop working in about a year and hardly any storage, I wouldn't use this phone they paid me.\n",

I contact the company to get a battery. Living overseas it is not easy replacing a battery for this model and when I purchased it I thought I was purchasing a \"working\" iphone. That was four months ago with no response from the company. Last week the phone did one better, it stopped charging completely and the touch screen literally exploded from the inside out. Although this phone has been in a draw in a protective case for a month when my son was no longer grounded we gave it back to him the touch screen as completely disconnected itself from the phone while the body of the phone was still in the protective case. My son tried to press the screen back into the body of the phone and then the screen cracked. This was a waste of money and time he never got a full months use out of the thing, we were better off just buying him a cheap prepaid phone at least it would have worked.\n",

I would highly recommend this seller and the product to my friends!After 3 months: The iphone still works, but it started to freeze randomly. Sometimes it shutsdown eventhough the battery is at 80 to 100%. It doesn't turn on, no matter what you do. Then somehow, it randomly turns on after 30 to 40 mins. Since I am a technician, I would say it is the case of refurbrished items. It is not the \"brand new\" item as listed. At my best guess, I would say these are the refurbrished items that are left over from carriers such as AT&T and verizon and later sold to third party sellers. CHEAP BUSINESS!

It came with a new set of genuine Apple earphones with remote and mic, dock connector to USB cable and USB power adapter. Touchscreen and battery seemed to be newly replaced as well!Googled around, selected a company on the internet that claimed to be the No. 1 iPhone unlock service provider; after payment to them, received from them a message claiming that \"software was being developed and would be available soon (without a commitment date when software will be available)\". Since then, I've never been able to get my money back through PayPal!Fortunately, there's a professional independent iPhone repair shop in town (not at&t, T-Mobile or Cincinnati Bell) who could help activate, jailbreak and unlock my phone; the phone works great now! I don't have to purchase a 2-year plan, I can use the best-deal package plan I want from either at&t, T-Mobile or Cincinnati Bell any time.

The only thing that let me know that the phone was used was that the port where the charger goes and the speakers had gotten a little dusty. So, in short, the phone arrived in like-new condition.As for the phone itself, it's worked fine for me so far. I've been using it for about two weeks now, and I haven't encountered any problems. The only complaints I have are about AT&T and their service, not the phone itself. It bears repeating that if you get this phone, it's not unlocked and you're stuck with AT&T.

The battery life goes quite quick, like in 2 hours with moderate use, a bit more time if standby. I think the battery may need replacing in the near future.I bought a backup battery you plug in..so I am all right, most of e time.You can still get a lot of apps, just not most new ones, as it use iOS 6.?I use the Phone with a provider that is only $15 a month including 400mb of data.Overall I am happy..to have a iPhone.

However, there were big issues with the batter.

I would strongly suggest that before you buy a used cell phone you ask the seller about the battery. In the end I returned the phone and they were quick with the refund.

It turns off constantly from something as simple as I am typing a text and receive a text at the same time. not pictures, just text, and the phone is not loaded up with anything, I don't have games or videos. It is simply a garbage phone. I did not heed the waning signs, I really wanted it to work, but alas, it doesn't.Update - I did not get a chance to change back over to my old cracked phone, but in the meantime I left the new one on a charger for a whole day and now it seems to be working fine. Perhaps they should include an instruction to do this before using the phone (although, I have never had another phone glitch out like that and not want to charge or take a full day to complete one full charge, so it still makes me think twice about keeping it)...

Hopefully I don't regret it...Just received this phone and in the last 24 hours it doesn't seem to get to full charge no matter how long it is plugged in. It has also turned off randomly at least 25 times during use and you turn it back on and it turns off a few more times before staying on for a couple hours, but as soon as it is being used to do anything it glitches and turns off within a few minutes. All I've done is text on it and read a few online articles, I don't even have apps or a ton of stored things, so no reason to glitch like this.\n",

Even the simplest things I do easily on every windows android or Linux device I've ever used.Of course every Microsoft OS has been extremely badly designed and Android sucks in its own ways, and haven't used Linux enough to have an opinion about it.But ios is the worst I've ever seen.With that and the nonremovable battery which will stop working in about a year and hardly any storage, I wouldn't use this phone they paid me.\n",

That was my fault, and because its an older model. and is on the newest firmware; the battery life is not all that great. 7 hours of use before it dies.Other reviews state that this company is shipping 3G phones instead of 3Gs.At first i thought the same thing until I called my carrear, and gave them the model number. They confirmed it was 3GS.Pros.Item arrived extremly quickly :-)As advertised it was brand new in box un-opened. :-)With moderate use, without the use of GPS, or downloading apps. Canging settings from 3G to 2G noticably increases the battery life.Over all i am extremly happy with my purchase.\n",

Youtube,bbc News, Google Maps, GPS apps, Amazon Prime video, kindle books. All of these apps worked fine with no errors. As well as Final Fantasy Dimensions. I would expect most games not to work in this, but the only ones I've tried are FFD and Bejeweled which work fine.

I contacted the seller and he replied saying how he could help I told him to refund the initial $15 dollars I spent he replied just saying he didn't know how to refund the money and never replied to any of my following emails.

It came with a new set of genuine Apple earphones with remote and mic, dock connector to USB cable and USB power adapter. Touchscreen and battery seemed to be newly replaced as well!Googled around, selected a company on the internet that claimed to be the No. 1 iPhone unlock service provider; after payment to them, received from them a message claiming that \"software was being developed and would be available soon (without a commitment date when software will be available)\". Since then, I've never been able to get my money back through PayPal!Fortunately, there's a professional independent iPhone repair shop in town (not at&t, T-Mobile or Cincinnati Bell) who could help activate, jailbreak and unlock my phone; the phone works great now! I don't have to purchase a 2-year plan, I can use the best-deal package plan I want from either at&t, T-Mobile or Cincinnati Bell any time.

The only thing that let me know that the phone was used was that the port where the charger goes and the speakers had gotten a little dusty. So, in short, the phone arrived in like-new condition.As for the phone itself, it's worked fine for me so far. I've been using it for about two weeks now, and I haven't encountered any problems. The only complaints I have are about AT&T and their service, not the phone itself. It bears repeating that if you get this phone, it's not unlocked and you're stuck with AT&T.

How long are they suppose to hold a charge? I have not used it yet nor have I went to see if it was unlocked or not. So I am wondering if the battery is good or has to be replaced. This is my first smart phone so I am \"DUH\" on the usage. Oh on the PayPal issue I have been waiting almost a year to get money back from them and that money came from my bank account. I did not use PayPal for payment. So GOOD LUCK. I love Amazon they ROCK!!!!\n",

When I called iTunes help center about an issue I had with the apps, when it was still working, I gave them the number inside the phone and they told me that the phone had been bought years ago, so it's DEFINITELY not new. I never would have bought it had I known it was used, refurbished, or whatever this was.\n",

I always had service with my htc so it is not my service provider. My friend who has the Iphone3 says the same thing.. very annoying.I was spoiled by having a gps tell me when to turn - the iphone 3 comes with a navigation system which is a lifesaver so and so often - but you still have to flip thru the steps manually as you go which can get you a ticket or killed at times.Some of the apps I could get for free for Android I have to pay for now.. bummer.The camera is terrible sadly, no flash, and no front screen camera..However, the phone works, it*s pretty, and if you use your phone mainly for calling and texting and only need the internet at times it works very well. I love the way the voicemails are set up!!!I don*t understand btw why apple makes the front screen from glass!

      "Although the description says \"Can be upgraded, factory unlocked for any GSM carrier\" AND again states \"ready to be used on any GSM carrier worldwide\". They need to put a disclaimer that says, \"Well... any GSM carrier EXCEPT Verizon Wireless\" because they can NOT be activated on Verizon wireless. The main reason, that I understand, is the mere fact that Verizon never had a 3g iPhone, so they don't have 3g SIM cards compatible with the iPhone and the 4g SIM cards they do have will not work in the iPhone 3gS. I tried my best to get the phone activated but it was just a huge waste of time. If you have Verizon, don't bother - it's not gonna work and its just going to cause you a huge headache.One the positive side, the phone itself was very nice. It appeared to be brand new, in the box with all the accessories. Although the USB cable is not Apple brand, the description does say it includes a 'compatible' USB cable. Everything else seems legit, it turned on and the screen was flawless and bright. Just disappointed I didn't do my research about the 3g/4g SIM card business.The seller, Better Deals FASTER, was very professional and understanding. I was able to return the phone and have my money refunded as soon as they received the phone back.Buyer Tip of the Day: do your HOMEWORK and know what your carrier can activate before you go around buying $200 phones!\n",

The phone holds its charge as expected (about two days of light use) and worked seamlessly once I inserted my T-Mobile sim card. Comes with the latest OS with which it is compatible(6.1.3). Note that OS 7 is not supported on the 3GS, but the majority of apps will run on it, as does iCloud. Given the cost of new iPhones (which are admittedly more powerful with crisper displays) I think the $149 that this goes for is a good bargain. If you are also looking for a reasonably priced case, see the eForCity 2 x TPU Rubber Skin Case Compatible With Apple® iPhone® 3G / 3GS, Clear Smoke Circle which I bought for under $3 including postage.

Using Skype ,front camera is not functioning even if the OS is already up to date.I'm still using the Iphone and did not return it to the seller because I'm avoiding the hassles of returns.Still I'm rating it with 3 stars.To the business owner who sold this item to me please screen your products carefully before shipping it out.In that way you can leave a very good impression to your future customers.Thank you and I hope this helps everybody who loves to shop online just like me as well as the merchants whose aim is customer satisfaction.\n",

The only other difference between the 2 is that the I4 has 2 camera,front and rear for video chatting. The I4 gs is the same as the I4 except Siri was added. IF you don't need your phone to talk to you and you don't need video chatting then the 3gs does everything else. It came with the latest upgrade of the IOS operating system and the screen was scratch free. While I don't understand it completely apparently there is a big difference between factory Unlocked and Jailbroken. It is my understanding that when jailbroken any upgrade re-locks the phone.

I always had service with my htc so it is not my service provider. My friend who has the Iphone3 says the same thing.. very annoying.I was spoiled by having a gps tell me when to turn - the iphone 3 comes with a navigation system which is a lifesaver so and so often - but you still have to flip thru the steps manually as you go which can get you a ticket or killed at times.Some of the apps I could get for free for Android I have to pay for now.. bummer.The camera is terrible sadly, no flash, and no front screen camera..However, the phone works, it*s pretty, and if you use your phone mainly for calling and texting and only need the internet at times it works very well. I love the way the voicemails are set up!!!I don*t understand btw why apple makes the front screen from glass!

      "Although the description says \"Can be upgraded, factory unlocked for any GSM carrier\" AND again states \"ready to be used on any GSM carrier worldwide\". They need to put a disclaimer that says, \"Well... any GSM carrier EXCEPT Verizon Wireless\" because they can NOT be activated on Verizon wireless. The main reason, that I understand, is the mere fact that Verizon never had a 3g iPhone, so they don't have 3g SIM cards compatible with the iPhone and the 4g SIM cards they do have will not work in the iPhone 3gS. I tried my best to get the phone activated but it was just a huge waste of time. If you have Verizon, don't bother - it's not gonna work and its just going to cause you a huge headache.One the positive side, the phone itself was very nice. It appeared to be brand new, in the box with all the accessories. Although the USB cable is not Apple brand, the description does say it includes a 'compatible' USB cable. Everything else seems legit, it turned on and the screen was flawless and bright. Just disappointed I didn't do my research about the 3g/4g SIM card business.The seller, Better Deals FASTER, was very professional and understanding. I was able to return the phone and have my money refunded as soon as they received the phone back.Buyer Tip of the Day: do your HOMEWORK and know what your carrier can activate before you go around buying $200 phones!\n",

I was surprised that she adapted fast to the iphone interface and started sending messages for us via Watsapa and calling us daily via Skype. In addition, she is taking and sending pictures.This is not the iphone 5 (not very high screen resolution, not powerful memory and processor). But it can run all the apps that the new iphone run and you can save around 500$. It is a great value for the money and I highly recommend it if you are on a limited budget.\n",

She has limited funds so newer model iPhones were not possible and past problems with used phones made that not an option. The 3GS is a dinosaur but it still has great features and is very easy for almost anyone to use. The iPhone 3GS purchased from Tablet Distributors and fulfilled by Amazon was as described, new and unlocked. It came in the original packaging with wall charger and headphones. I do not think the wall charger provided works but the old one is fine so I don't care. I upgraded to the latest iOS, restored contacts, and connected to Straight Talk without problems.

      "I was skeptical about buying the unlock iPhone 3GS from Amazon after seeing the bad reviews, but I checked with the seller and went ahead and purchased it after he confirmed it. I gotta say, I'm very happy with this purchase. It wasn't hard to set up the sim's card into the device. It came in the mail like it was brand new with the original packaging and everything. I love texting and calling my friends and family with it. I have experienced the white screen of death, but I restarted it without a second thought and everything has been fine ever since. I haven't really experience any serious heating problems and I've played some high capacity games on it while being plugged in. It does get rather warm in the hands, but it wasn't enough to be uncomfortable for me. The main reason why I got this phone was because I wanted an easier and more convenient way to call and text my friends and family. The phone I had before was a flip phone without a proper keyboard. This does what I want and so much more. For $115, I got a really good deal and I'm happy to say that I'll be using this until my dad stops paying for the contract or it does die out on me. Just to let those who have flip phones know, the iPhone 3GS can PREVENT data being used when you're not on that plan. The flip phone that I had would take me onto the web without warning me first and that caused my phone to be charged a few extra dollars for just a few seconds of being on the internet. At least now, I don't have to worry about those slippages because I can only use data when i'm using wi-fi.I don't really have any complaints for this phone because it's more then what I want in an phone, but as an Apple product, I have to say that the screen really takes a miss. I'm so spoiled by Retina Display on my iPod Touch 5g, that it bugs me when everything is in low resolution. When comparing watching videos or pictures, it's just ain't the same. It's good when I'm bored at college, but for casual use, it's not that great from today's standards.It's a little bulky, but I kind of like it that way. It gives it a feel to it and it doesn't slip out of my hands unlike the new iPod Touch.Seeing that I got the white screen of death on the second day scared me. I'm hoping that wasn't the reason why the seller sold it to me.Summery:Pros:Great for a phone and great for texting.Has great cellular connection.Satisfying battery life.Can handle playing games without taking too much heat.Can prevent using data on cellular network unlike my old flip phone.Cons:Poor screen quality compared to today's standard for Apple products.Sort of bulky, but having some weight is a pro for me.White screen of death on the second day of using it.\n",

Although they have returning policy but with some condition, for example you have to pay some money for that. I bought a iphone 3 before this one from this same seller. I didn't know I could not purchase software from apple store with iphone 3 until i received it. But if I returned it, i had to pay the mail fees and the about 15% (?) of the price to the seller. Anyway, if the seller could better the service, it will be perfect.\n",

      "This unlocked phone works great on T-Mobile. I just had to insert the SIM card from my old black-berry phone. Within a few minutes, it got signal. Because it was factory unlocked, it was updated to to iOS 6 just fine and remained unlocked afterward. Don't buy those iPhones that are unlocked by software, because you can't update iOS.My existing T-Mobile contract doesn't have a data plan. All I had to do was disabling 3G and Data from Settings > General > Cellular. After that Wi-Fi works fine and I don't have to pay for a data plan.Note that if you do a factory reset on the phone, the only way to get through the initial setup is either by having a data plan or activate via USB cable attached to a computer having iTune installed.The condition of the phone is dependent on who you buy it from.

      "I was skeptical about buying the unlock iPhone 3GS from Amazon after seeing the bad reviews, but I checked with the seller and went ahead and purchased it after he confirmed it. I gotta say, I'm very happy with this purchase. It wasn't hard to set up the sim's card into the device. It came in the mail like it was brand new with the original packaging and everything. I love texting and calling my friends and family with it. I have experienced the white screen of death, but I restarted it without a second thought and everything has been fine ever since. I haven't really experience any serious heating problems and I've played some high capacity games on it while being plugged in. It does get rather warm in the hands, but it wasn't enough to be uncomfortable for me. The main reason why I got this phone was because I wanted an easier and more convenient way to call and text my friends and family. The phone I had before was a flip phone without a proper keyboard. This does what I want and so much more. For $115, I got a really good deal and I'm happy to say that I'll be using this until my dad stops paying for the contract or it does die out on me. Just to let those who have flip phones know, the iPhone 3GS can PREVENT data being used when you're not on that plan. The flip phone that I had would take me onto the web without warning me first and that caused my phone to be charged a few extra dollars for just a few seconds of being on the internet. At least now, I don't have to worry about those slippages because I can only use data when i'm using wi-fi.I don't really have any complaints for this phone because it's more then what I want in an phone, but as an Apple product, I have to say that the screen really takes a miss. I'm so spoiled by Retina Display on my iPod Touch 5g, that it bugs me when everything is in low resolution. When comparing watching videos or pictures, it's just ain't the same. It's good when I'm bored at college, but for casual use, it's not that great from today's standards.It's a little bulky, but I kind of like it that way. It gives it a feel to it and it doesn't slip out of my hands unlike the new iPod Touch.Seeing that I got the white screen of death on the second day scared me. I'm hoping that wasn't the reason why the seller sold it to me.Summery:Pros:Great for a phone and great for texting.Has great cellular connection.Satisfying battery life.Can handle playing games without taking too much heat.Can prevent using data on cellular network unlike my old flip phone.Cons:Poor screen quality compared to today's standard for Apple products.Sort of bulky, but having some weight is a pro for me.White screen of death on the second day of using it.\n",
